<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book makes no pretence of furnishing a mirror of
contemporary Japanese religion. Since 1868, Japan has been breaking
the chains of her intellectual bondage to China and India, and the
end is not yet. My purpose has been, not to take a snap-shot
photograph, but to paint a picture of the past. Seen in a
lightning-flash, even a tempest-shaken tree appears motionless. A
study of the same organism from acorn to seed-bearing oak, reveals
not a phase but a life. It is something like this&mdash;"<i>to</i>
the era of Meiji" (A.D. 1868-1894+) which I have essayed. Hence I
am perfectly willing to accept, in advance, the verdict of smart
inventors who are all ready to patent a brand-new religion for
Japan, that my presentation is "antiquated."</p>
<p>The subject has always been fascinating, despite its inherent
difficulties and the author's personal limitations. When in 1807,
the polite lads from Satsuma and Ki[=o]to came to New Brunswick,
N.J., they found at least one eager questioner, a sophomore, who,
while valuing books, enjoyed at first hand contemporaneous human
testimony.</p>
<p>When in 1869, to Rutgers College, came an application through
Rev. Dr. Guido F. Verbeck, of T[=o]ki[=o], from Fukui for a young
man to organize schools upon the American principle in the province
of Echizen (ultra-Buddhistic, yet already so liberally leavened by
the ethical teachings of Yokoi H&eacute;ishiro), the Faculty made
choice of the author. Accepting the honor and privilege of being
one of the "beginners of a better time," I caught sight of peerless
Fuji and set foot on Japanese soil December 29, 1870. Amid a
cannonade of new sensations and fresh surprises, my first walk was
taken in company with the American missionary (once a marine in
Perry's squadron, who later invented the jin-riki-sha), to see a
hill-temple and to study the wayside shrines around Yokohama. Seven
weeks' stay in the city of Yedo&mdash;then rising out of the
d&eacute;bris of feudalism to become the Imperial capital,
T[=o]ki[=o], enabled me to see some things now so utterly vanished,
that by some persons their previous existence is questioned. One of
the most interesting characters I met personally was Fukuzawa, the
reformer, and now "the intellectual father of half of the young men
of ... Japan." On the day of the battle of Uy&eacute;no, July 11,
1868, this far-seeing patriot and inquiring spirit deliberately
decided to keep out of the strife, and with four companions of like
mind, began the study of Wayland's Moral Science. Thus were laid
the foundations of his great school, now a university.</p>
<p>Journeying through the interior, I saw many interesting
phenomena of popular religions which are no longer visible. At
Fukui in Echizen, one of the strongholds of Buddhism, I lived
nearly a year, engaged in educational work, having many
opportunities of learning both the scholastic and the popular forms
of Shint[=o] and of Buddhism. I was surrounded by monasteries,
temples, shrines, and a landscape richly embroidered with myth and
legend. During my four years' residence and travel in the Empire, I
perceived that in all things the people of Japan were <i>too</i>
religious.</p>
<p>In seeking light upon the meaning of what I saw before me and in
penetrating to the reasons behind the phenomena, I fear I often
made myself troublesome to both priests and lay folk. While at work
in T[=o]ki[=o], though under obligation to teach only physical
science, I voluntarily gave instruction in ethics to classes in the
University. I richly enjoyed this work, which, by questioning and
discussion, gave me much insight into the minds of young men whose
homes were in every province of the Empire. In my own house I felt
free to teach to all comers the religion of Jesus, his revelation
of the fatherhood of God and the ethics based on his life and
words. While, therefore, in studying the subject, I have great
indebtedness to acknowledge to foreigners, I feel that first of all
I must thank the natives who taught me so much both by precept and
practice. Among the influences that have helped to shape my own
creed and inspire my own life, have been the beautiful lives and
noble characters of Japanese officers, students and common people
who were around and before me. Though freely confessing obligation
to books, writings, and artistic and scholastic influences, I
hasten first to thank the people of Japan, whether servants,
superior officers, neighbors or friends. He who seeks to learn what
religion is from books only, will learn but half.</p>
<p>Gladly thanking those, who, directly or indirectly, have helped
me with light from the written or printed page, I must first of all
gratefully express my especial obligations to those native scholars
who have read to me, read for me, or read with me their native
literature.</p>
<p>The first foreign students of Japanese religions were the Dutch,
and the German physicians who lived with them, at D&eacute;shima.
Kaempfer makes frequent references, with test and picture, in his
Beschryving van Japan. Von Siebold, who was an indefatigable
collector rather than a critical student, in Vol. V. of his
invaluable <i>Archiv</i> (Pantheon von Nippon), devoted over forty
pages to the religions of Japan. Dr. J.J. Hoffman translated into
Dutch, with notes and explanations, the Butsu-z[=o]-dzu-i, which,
besides its 163 figures of Buddhist holy men, gives a bibliography
of the works mentioned by the native author. In visiting the
Japanese museum on the Rapenburg, Leyden, one of the oldest, best
and most intelligently arranged in Europe, I have been interested
with the great work done by the Dutchmen, during two centuries, in
leavening the old lump for that transformation which in our day as
New Japan, surprises the world. It requires the shock of battle to
awaken the western nations to that appreciation of the racial and
other differences between the Japanese and Chinese, which the
student has already learned.</p>
<p>The first praises, however, are to be awarded to the English
scholars, Messrs. Satow, Aston, Chamberlain, and others, whose
profound researches in Japanese history, language and literature
have cleared the path for others to tread in. I have tried to
acknowledge my debt to them in both text and appendix.</p>
<p>To several American missionaries, who despite their trying
labors have had the time and the taste to study critically the
religions of Japan, I owe thanks and appreciation. With rare
acuteness and learning, Rev. Dr. George Wm. Knox has opened on its
philosophical, and Rev. Dr. J.H. DeForest on its practical side,
the subject of Japanese Confucianism. By his lexicographical work,
Dr. J.C. Hepburn has made debtors to him both the native and the
alien. To our knowledge of Buddhism in Japan, Dr. J.C. Berry and
Rev. J.L. Atkinson have made noteworthy contributions. I have been
content to quote as authorities and illustrations, the names of
those who have thus wrought on the soil, rather than of those, who,
even though world-famous, have been but slightly familiar with the
ethnic and the imported faith of Japan. The profound
misunderstandings of Buddhism, which some very eminent men of
Europe have shown in their writings, form one of the literary
curiosities of the world.</p>
<p>In setting forth these Morse lectures, I have purposely robbed
my pages of all appearance of erudition, by using as few uncouth
words as possible, by breaking up the matter into paragraphs of
moderate length, by liberally introducing subject-headings in
italics, and by relegating all notes to the appendix. Since writing
the lectures, and even while reading the final proofs, I have
ransacked my library to find as many references, notes,
illustrations and authorities as possible, for the benefit of the
general student. I have purposely avoided recondite and
inaccessible books and have named those easily obtainable from
American or European publishers, or from Messrs. Kelly &amp; Walsh,
of Yokohama, Japan. In using oriental words I have followed, in the
main, the spelling of the Century Dictionary. The Japanese names
are expressed according to that uniform system of transliteration
used by Hepburn, Satow and other standard writers, wherein
consonants have the same general value as in English (except that
initial g is always hard), while the vowels are pronounced as in
Italian. Double vowels must be pronounced double, as in
M&eacute;iji (m[=a]-[=e]-j[=e]); those which are long are marked,
as in [=o] or [=u]; i before o or u is short. Most of the important
Japanese, as well as Sanskrit and Chinese, terms used, are duly
expressed and defined in the Century Dictionary.</p>
<p>I wish also to thank especially my friends, Riu Watanabe, Ph.D.,
of Cornell University, and William Nelson Noble, Esq., of Ithaca.
The former kindly assisted me with criticisms and suggestions,
while to the latter, who has taken time to read all the proofs, I
am grateful for considerable improvement in the English form of the
sentences.</p>
<p>In closing, I trust that whatever charges may be brought against
me by competent critics, lack of sympathy will not be one. I write
in sight of beautiful Lake Cayuga, on the fertile and sloping
shores of which in old time the Iroquois Indian confessed the
mysteries of life. Having planted his corn, he made his pregnant
squaw walk round the seed-bed in hope of receiving from the Source
of life increased blessing and sustenance for body and mind.
Between such a truly religious act of the savage, and that of the
Christian sage, Joseph Henry, who uncovered his head while
investigating electro-magnetism to "ask God a question," or that of
Samuel F.B. Morse, who sent as his first telegraphic message "What
hath God wrought," I see no essential difference. All three were
acts of faith and acknowledgment of a power greater than man.
Religion is one, though religions are many. As Principal Fairbairn,
my honored predecessor in the Morse lectureship, says: "What we
call superstition of the savage is not superstition <i>in him</i>.
Superstition is the perpetuation of a low form of belief along with
a higher knowledge.... Between fetichism and Christian faith there
is a great distance, but a great affinity&mdash;the recognition of
a supra-sensible life."</p>
<p>"For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the
revealing of the sons of God.... The creation itself shall be
delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the
glory of the children of God."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I - PRIMITIVE FAITH: RELIGION BEFORE BOOKS</h2>
<h3>The Morse Lectureship and the Study of Comparative
Religion</h3>
<p>As a graduate of the Union Theological Seminary in the city of
New York, in the Class of 1877, your servant received and accepted
with pleasure the invitation of the President and Board of Trustees
to deliver a course of lectures upon the religions of Japan. In
that country and in several parts of it, I lived from 1870 to 1874.
I was in the service first of the feudal daimi[=o] of Echizen and
then of the national government of Japan, helping to introduce that
system of public schools which is now the glory of the country.
Those four years gave me opportunities for close and constant
observation of the outward side of the religions of Japan, and
facilities for the study of the ideas out of which worship springs.
Since 1867, however, when first as a student in Rutgers College at
New Brunswick, N.J., I met and instructed those students from the
far East, who, at risk of imprisonment and death had come to
America for the culture of Christendom, I have been deeply
interested in the study of the Japanese people and their
thoughts.</p>
<p>To attempt a just and impartial survey of the religions of Japan
may seem a task that might well appall <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>{4}</span> even a
life-long Oriental scholar. Yet it may be that an honest purpose, a
deep sympathy and a gladly avowed desire to help the East and the
West, the Japanese and the English-speaking people, to understand
each other, are not wholly useless in a study of religion, but for
our purpose of real value. These lectures are upon the Morse<a id=
"footnotetag1-1" name="footnotetag1-1"></a><a href=
"#footnote1-1"><sup>1</sup></a> foundation which has these
specifications written out by the founder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The general subject of the lectures I desire to be: "The
Relation of the Bible to any of the Sciences, as Geography,
Geology, History, and Ethnology, ... and the relation of the facts
and truths contained in the Word of God, to the principles,
methods, and aims of any of the sciences."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, among the sciences which we must call to our aid are those
of geography and geology, by which are conditioned history and
ethnology of which we must largely treat; and, most of all, the
science of Comparative Religion.</p>
<p>This last is Christianity's own child. Other sciences, such as
geography and astronomy, may have been born among lands and nations
outside of and even before Christendom. Other sciences, such as
geology, may have had their rise in Christian time and in Christian
lands, their foundation lines laid and their main processes
illustrated by Christian men, which yet cannot be claimed by
Christianity as her children bearing her own likeness and image;
but the science of Comparative Religion is the direct offspring of
the religion of Jesus. It is a distinctively Christian science. "It
is so because it is a product of Christian civilization, and
because it finds its impulse in that freedom of inquiry which
Christianity fosters."<a id="footnotetag1-2" name=
"footnotetag1-2"></a><a href="#footnote1-2"><sup>2</sup></a>
Christian scholars began <span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id=
"page5"></a>{5}</span> the investigations, formulated the
principles, collected the materials and reared the already splendid
fabric of the science of Comparative Religion, because the spirit
of Christ which was in them did signify this. Jesus bade his
disciples search, inquire, discern and compare. Paul, the greatest
of the apostolic Christian college, taught: "Prove all things; hold
fast that which is good." In our day one of Christ's loving
followers<a id="footnotetag1-3" name="footnotetag1-3"></a><a href=
"#footnote1-3"><sup>3</sup></a> expressed the spirit of her Master
in her favorite motto, "Truth for authority, not authority for
truth." Well says Dr. James Legge, a prince among scholars, and
translator of the Chinese classics, who has added several portly
volumes to Professor Max M&uuml;ller's series of the "Sacred Books
of the East," whose face to-day is bronzed and whose hair is
whitened by fifty years of service in southern China where with his
own hands he baptized six hundred Chinamen:<a id="footnotetag1-4"
name="footnotetag1-4"></a><a href=
"#footnote1-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more that a man possesses the Christian spirit, and is
governed by Christian principle, the more anxious will he be to do
justice to every other system of religion, and to hold his own
without taint or fetter of bigotry.<a id="footnotetag1-5" name=
"footnotetag1-5"></a><a href="#footnote1-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was Christianity that, in a country where the religion of
Jesus has fullest liberty, called the Parliament of Religions, and
this for reasons clearly manifest. Only Christians had and have the
requisites of success, viz.: sufficient interest in other men and
religions; the necessary unity of faith and purpose; and above all,
the brave and bold disregard of the consequences. Christianity
calls the Parliament of Religions, following out the Divine
audacity of Him who, so often, confronting worldly wisdom and
priestly cunning, said to his disciples, "Think not, be not
anxious, take no heed, be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id=
"page6"></a>{6}</span> careful for nothing&mdash;only for love and
truth. I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil."</p>
<p>Of all places therefore, the study of comparative religion is
most appropriate in a Christian theological seminary. We must know
how our fellow-men think and believe, in order to help them. It is
our duty to discover the pathways of approach to their minds and
hearts. We must show them, as our brethren and children of the same
Heavenly Father, the common ground on which we all stand. We must
point them to the greater truth in the Bible and in Christ Jesus,
and demonstrate wherein both the divinely inspired library and the
truth written in a divine-human life fulfil that which is lacking
in their books and masters.</p>
<p>To know just how to do this is knowledge to be coveted as a most
excellent gift. An understanding of the religion of our fellow-men
is good, both for him who goes as a missionary and for him who at
home prays, "Thy kingdom come."</p>
<p>The theological seminary, which begins the systematic and
sympathetic study of Comparative Religion and fills the chair with
a professor who has a vital as well as academic interest in the
welfare of his fellow-men who as yet know not Jesus as Christ and
Lord, is sure to lead in effective missionary work. The students
thus equipped will be furnished as none others are, to begin at
once the campaign of help and warfare of love.</p>
<p>It may be that insight into and sympathy with the struggles of
men who are groping after God, if haply they may find him, will
shorten the polemic sword of the professional converter whose only
purpose is destructive hostility without tactics or strategy, or
whose <span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id=
"page7"></a>{7}</span> chief idea of missionary success is in
statistics, in blackening the character of "the heathen," in
sensational letters for home consumption and reports properly
cooked and served for the secretarial and sectarian palates. Yet,
if true in history, Greek, Roman, Japanese, it is also true in the
missionary wars, that "the race that shortens its weapons lengthens
its boundaries."<a id="footnotetag1-6" name=
"footnotetag1-6"></a><a href="#footnote1-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Apart from the wit or the measure of truth in this sentence
quoted, it is a matter of truth in the generalizations of fact that
the figure of the "sword of the spirit, which is the word of God,"
used by Paul, and also the figure of the "word of God, living and
active, sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the
dividing of the soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and
quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart," of the
writer to the Hebrews, had for their original in iron the
victorious <i>gladium</i> of the Roman legionary&mdash;a weapon
both short and sharp. We may learn from this substance of fact
behind the shadow of the figure a lesson for our instant
application. The disciplined Romans scorned the long blades of the
barbarians, whose valor so often impetuous was also impotent
against discipline. The Romans measured their blades by inches, not
by feet. For ages the Japanese sword has been famed for its temper
more than its weight.<a id="footnotetag1-7" name=
"footnotetag1-7"></a><a href="#footnote1-7"><sup>7</sup></a> The
Christian entering upon his Master's campaigns with as little
impediments of sectarian dogma as possible, should select a weapon
that is short, sure and divinely tempered.</p>
<p>To know exactly the defects of the religion we seek to abolish,
modify, supplement, supplant or fulfil, means wise economy of
force. To get at the secrets of its hold upon the people we hope to
convert leads to a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id=
"page8"></a>{8}</span> right use of power. In a word, knowledge of
the opposing religion, and especially of alien language, literature
and ways of feeling and thinking, lengthens missionary life. A man
who does not know the moulds of thought of his hearers is like a
swordsman trying to fight at long range but only beating the air.
Armed with knowledge and sympathy, the missionary smites with
effect at close quarters. He knows the vital spots.</p>
<p>Let me fortify my own convictions and conclude this preliminary
part of my lectures by quoting again, not from academic
authorities, but from active missionaries who are or have been at
the front and in the field.<a id="footnotetag1-8" name=
"footnotetag1-8"></a><a href="#footnote1-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The Rev. Samuel Beal, author of "Buddhism in China," said (p.
19) that "it was plain to him that no real work could be done among
the people [of China and Japan] by missionaries until the system of
their belief was understood."</p>
<p>The Rev. James MacDonald, a veteran missionary in Africa, in the
concluding chapter of his very able work on "Religion and Myth,"
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Church that first adopts for her intending missionaries the
study of Comparative Religion as a substitute for subjects now
taught will lead the van in the path of true progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The People of Japan.</h3>
<p>In this faith then, in the spirit of Him who said, "I come not
to destroy but to fulfil," let us cast our eyes upon that part of
the world where lies the empire of Japan with its forty-one
millions of souls. Here we have not a country like India&mdash;a
vast conglomeration of nations, languages and religions occupying a
peninsula <span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id=
"page9"></a>{9}</span> itself like a continent, whose history
consists of a stratification of many civilizations. Nor have we
here a seemingly inert mass of humanity in a political structure
blending democracy and imperialism, as in China, so great in age,
area and numbers as to weary the imagination that strives to grasp
the details. On the contrary, in Dai Nippon, or Great Land of the
Sun's Origin, we have a little country easy of study. In geology it
is one of the youngest of lands. Its known history is comparatively
modern. Its area roughly reckoned as 150,000 square miles, is about
that of our Dakotas or of Great Britain and Ireland. The census
completed December 31, 1892, illustrates here, as all over the
world, nature's argument against polygamy. It tells us that the
relation between the sexes is, numerically at least, normal. There
were 20,752,366 males and 20,337,574 females, making a population
of 41,089,940 souls. All these people are subjects of the one
emperor, and excepting fewer than twenty thousand savages in the
northern islands called Ainos, speak one language and form
substantially one race. Even the Riu Kiu islanders are Japanese in
language, customs and religion. In a word, except in minor
differences appreciable or at least important only to the special
student, the modern Japanese are a homogeneous people.</p>
<p>In origin and formation, this people is a composite of many
tribes. Roughly outlining the ethnology of Japan, we should say
that the aborigines were immigrants from the continent with Malay
reinforcement in the south, Koreans in the centre, and Ainos in the
east and north, with occasional strains of blood at different
periods from various parts of the Asian mainland. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>{10}</span> In brief,
the Japanese are a very mixed race. Authentic history before the
Christian era is unknown. At some point of time, probably later
than A.D. 200, a conquering tribe, one of many from the Asian
mainland, began to be paramount on the main island. About the
fourth century something like historic events and personages begin
to be visible, but no Japanese writings are older than the early
part of the eighth century, though almanacs and means of measuring
time are found in the sixth century. Whatever Japan may be in
legend and mythology, she is in fact and in history younger than
Christianity. Her line of rulers, as alleged in old official
documents and ostentatiously reaffirmed in the first article of the
constitution of 1889, to be "unbroken for ages eternal," is no
older than that of the popes. Let us not think of Aryan or Chinese
antiquity when we talk of Japan. Her history as a state began when
the Roman empire fell. The Germanic nations emerged into history
long before the Japanese.</p>
<p>Roughly outlining the political and religious life of the
ancient Japanese, we note that their first system of government was
a rude sort of feudalism imposed by the conquerors and was
synchronous with aboriginal fetichism, nature worship, ancestral
sacrifices, sun-worship and possibly but not probably, a very rude
sort of monotheism akin to the primitive Chinese cultus.<a id=
"footnotetag1-9" name="footnotetag1-9"></a><a href=
"#footnote1-9"><sup>9</sup></a> Almost contemporary with Buddhism,
its introduction and missionary development, was the struggle for
centralized imperialism borrowed from the Chinese and consolidated
in the period from the seventh to the twelfth century. During most
of this time Shint[=o], or the primitive religion, was overshadowed
while the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id=
"page11"></a>{11}</span> Confucian ethics were taught. From the
twelfth to this nineteenth century feudalism in politics and
Buddhism in religion prevailed, though Confucianism furnished the
social laws or rules of daily conduct. Since the epochal year of
1868, with imperialism reestablished and the feudal system
abolished, Shint[=o] has had a visible revival, being kept alive by
government patronage. Buddhism, though politically disestablished,
is still the popular religion with recent increase of life,<a id=
"footnotetag1-10" name="footnotetag1-10"></a><a href=
"#footnote1-10"><sup>10</sup></a> while Confucianism is decidedly
losing force. Christianity has begun its promising career.</p>
<h3>The Amalgam of Religions.</h3>
<p>Yet in the imperial and constitutional Japan of our day it is
still true of probably at least thirty-eight millions of Japanese
that their religion is not one, Shint[=o], Confucianism or
Buddhism, but an amalgam of all three. There is not in every-day
life that sharp distinction between these religions which the
native or foreign scholar makes, and which both history and
philosophy demand shall be made for the student at least. Using the
technical language of Christian theologians, Shint[=o] furnishes
theology, Confucianism anthropology and Buddhism soteriology. The
average Japanese learns about the gods and draws inspiration for
his patriotism from Shint[=o], maxims for his ethical and social
life from Confucius, and his hope of what he regards as salvation
from Buddhism. Or, as a native scholar, Nobuta Kishimoto,<a id=
"footnotetag1-11" name="footnotetag1-11"></a><a href=
"#footnote1-11"><sup>11</sup></a> expresses it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Japan these three different systems of religion and morality
are not only living together on friendly terms with one another,
but, in fact, they are blended together in the minds <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>{12}</span> of the
people, who draw necessary nourishment from all of these sources.
One and the same Japanese is both a Shint[=o]ist, a Confucianist,
and a Buddhist. He plays a triple part, so to speak ... Our
religion may be likened to a triangle.... Shint[=o]ism furnishes
the object, Confucianism offers the rules of life, while Buddhism
supplies the way of salvation; so you see we Japanese are eclectic
in everything, even in religion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These three religious systems as at present constituted, are
"book religions." They rest, respectively, upon the Kojiki and
other ancient Japanese literature and the modern commentators; upon
the Chinese classics edited and commented on by Confucius and upon
Chu Hi and other mediaeval scholastics who commented upon
Confucius; and upon the shastras and sutras with which Gautama, the
Buddha, had something to do. Yet in primeval and prehistoric Nippon
neither these books nor the religions growing out of the books were
extant. Furthermore, strictly speaking, it is not with any or all
of these three religions that the Christian missionary comes first,
oftenest or longest in contact. In ancient, in mediaeval, and in
modern times the student notices a great undergrowth of
superstition clinging parasitically to all religions, though
formally recognized by none. Whether we call it fetichism,
shamanism, nature worship or heathenism in its myriad forms, it is
there in awful reality. It is as omnipresent, as persistent, as
hard to kill as the scrub bamboo which both efficiently and
sufficiently takes the place of thorns and thistles as the curse of
Japanese ground.</p>
<p>The book-religions can be more or less apprehended by those
alien to them, but to fully appreciate the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>{13}</span> depth,
extent, influence and tenacity of these archaic, unwritten and
unformulated beliefs requires residence upon the soil and life
among the devotees. Disowned it may be by the priests and sages,
indignantly disclaimed or secretly approved in part by the
organized religions, this great undergrowth of superstition is as
apparent as the silicious bamboo grass which everywhere conditions
and modifies Japanese agriculture. Such prevalence of mental and
spiritual disease is the sad fact that confronts every lover of his
fellow-men. This paganism is more ancient and universal than any
one of the religions founded on writing or teachers of name and
fame. Even the applied science and the wonderful inventions
imported from the West, so far from eradicating it, only serve as
the iron-clad man-of-war in warm salt water serves the barnacles,
furnishing them food and hold.</p>
<p>We propose to give in this our first lecture, a general or
bird's-eye view of this dead level of paganism above which the
systems of Shint[=o], Confucianism and Buddhism tower like
mountains. It in by this omnipresent superstition that the
respectable religious have been conditioned in their history and
are modified at present, even as Christianity has been influenced
in its progress by ethnic or local ideas and temperaments, and will
be yet in its course of victory in the Mikado's empire.</p>
<p>Just as the terms "heathen" (happily no longer, in the Revised
Version of the English Bible) and "pagan" suggest the heath-man of
Northern Europe and the isolated hamlet of the Roman empire, while
the cities were illuminated with Christian truth, so, in the main,
the matted superstitious of Chinese Asia are <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>{14}</span> more
suggestive of distances from books and centres of knowledge, though
still sufficiently rooted in the crowded cities.</p>
<p>One to whom the boundary line between the Creator and his world
is perfectly clear, one who knows the eternal difference between
mind and matter, one born amid the triumphs of science can but
faintly realize the mental condition of the millions of Japan to
whom there is no unifying thought of the Creator-Father. Faith in
the unity of law is the foundation of all science, but the average
Asiatic has not this thought or faith. Appalled at his own
insignificance amid the sublime mysteries and awful immensities of
nature, the shadows of his own mind become to him real existences.
As it is affirmed that the human skin, sensitive to the effects of
light, takes the photograph of the tree riven by lightning, so, on
the pagan mind lie in ineffaceable and exaggerated grotesqueness
the scars of impressions left by hereditary teaching, by natural
phenomena and by the memory of events and of landmarks. Out of the
soil of diseased imagination has sprung up a growth as terrible as
the drunkard's phantasies. The earthquake, flood, tidal wave,
famine, withering or devastating wind and poisonous gases, the
geological monsters and ravening bird, beast and fish, have their
representatives or supposed incarnations in mythical phantasms.</p>
<p>Frightful as these shadows of the mind appear, they are both
very real and, in a sense, very necessary to the ignorant man. He
must have some theory by which to explain the phenomena of nature
and soothe his own terrors. Hence he peoples the earth and water,
not only with invisible spirits more or less malevolent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>{15}</span>
but also with bodily presences usually in terrific bestial form. To
those who believe in one Spirit pervading, ordering, governing all
things, there is unity amid all phenomena, and the universe is all
order and beauty. To the mind which has not reached this height of
simplicity, instead of one cause there are many. The diverse
phenomena of nature are brought about by spirits innumerable,
warring and discordant. Instead of a unity to the mind, as of sun
and solar system, there is nothing but planets, asteroids and a
constant rain of shooting-stars.</p>
<h3>Shamanism.</h3>
<p>Glancing at some phases of the actual unwritten religions of
Japan we name Shamanism, Mythical Zo&ouml;logy, Fetichism,
Phallicism, and Tree and Serpent Worship.</p>
<p>In actual Shamanism or Animism there may or there may not be a
belief in or conception of a single all-powerful Creator above and
beyond all.<a id="footnotetag1-12" name=
"footnotetag1-12"></a><a href="#footnote1-12"><sup>12</sup></a>
Usually there is not such a belief, though, even if there be, the
actual government of the physical world and its surroundings is
believed to lie in the hands of many spirits or gods benevolent and
malevolent. Earth, air, water, all things teem with beings that are
malevolent and constantly active. In time of disaster, famine,
epidemic the universe seems as overcrowded with them as stagnant
water seems to be when the solar microscope throw its contents into
apparition upon the screen. It is absolutely necessary to
propitiate these spirits by magic rites and incantations.</p>
<p>Among the tribes of the northern part of the Chinese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>{16}</span>
Empire and the Ainos of Japan this Shamanism exists as something
like an organized cultus. Indeed, it would be hard to find any part
of Chinese Asia from Korea to Annam or from Tibet to Formosa, not
dominated by this belief in the power and presence of minor
spirits. The Ainos of Yezo may be called Shamanists or Animists;
that is, their minds are cramped and confused by their belief in a
multitude of inferior spirits whom they worship and propitiate by
rites and incantations through their medicine-man or sorcerer. How
they whittle sticks, keeping on the fringe of curled shavings, and
set up these, called <i>inao</i> in places whence evil is suspected
to lurk, and how the shaman conducts his exorcisms and works his
healings, are told in the works of the traveller and the
missionary.<a id="footnotetag1-13" name=
"footnotetag1-13"></a><a href="#footnote1-13"><sup>13</sup></a> In
the wand of shavings thus reared we see the same motive as that
which induced the Mikado in the eighth century to build the great
monasteries on Hiy&eacute;izan, northeast of Ki[=o]to, this being
the quarter in which Buddhist superstition locates the path of
advancing evil, to ward off malevolence by litanies and incense.
Or, the <i>inao</i> is a sort of lightning-rod conductor by which
impending mischief may be led harmlessly away.</p>
<p>Yet, besides the Ainos,<a id="footnotetag1-14" name=
"footnotetag1-14"></a><a href="#footnote1-14"><sup>14</sup></a>
there are millions of Japanese who are Shamanists, even though they
know not the name or organized cult. And if we make use of the term
Shamanism instead of the more exact one of Animism, it is for the
very purpose of illustrating our contention that the underlying
paganisms of the Japanese archipelago, unwritten and unformulated,
are older than the religions founded on books; and that these
paganisms, still vital and persistent, constantly modify and
corrupt the recognized religious. The term Shaman, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>{17}</span> a Pali word,
was originally a pure Buddhist term meaning one who has separated
from his family and his passions. One of the designations of the
Buddha was Shamana-Gautama. The same word, Shamon, in Japanese
still means a bonze, or Buddhist priest. Its appropriation by the
sorcerers, medicine-men, and lords of the misrule of superstition
in Mongolia and Manchuria shows decisively how indigenous paganism
has corrupted the Buddhism of northern Asia even as it has caused
its decay in Japan.</p>
<p>As out of Animism or Shamanism grows Fetichism in which a
visible object is found for the abode or medium of the spirit, so
also, out of the same soil arises what we may call Imaginary
Zo&ouml;logy. In this mental growth, the nightmare of the diseased
imagination or of the mind unable to draw the line between the real
and the unreal, Chinese Asia differs notably from the Aryan world.
With the mythical monsters of India and Iran we are acquainted, and
with those of the Semitic and ancient European cycle of ideas which
furnished us with our ancients and classics we are familiar. The
lovely presences in human form, the semi-human and bestial
creations, sphinxes, naiads, satyrs, fauns, harpies, griffins, with
which the fancy of the Mediterranean nations populated glen,
grotto, mountain and stream, are probably outnumbered by the less
beautiful and even hideous mind-shadows of the Turanian world.
Chief among these are what in Chinese literature, so slavishly
borrowed by the Japanese, are called the four supernatural or
spiritually endowed creatures&mdash;the Kirin or Unicorn, the
Phoenix, the Tortoise and the Dragon.<a id="footnotetag1-15" name=
"footnotetag1-15"></a><a href="#footnote1-15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>{18}</span>
<h3>Mythical Zo&ouml;logy.</h3>
<p>Of the first species the <i>ki</i> is the male, the <i>lin</i>
is the female, hence the name Kilin. The Japanese having no
<i>l</i>, pronounce this Kirin. Its appearance on the earth is
regarded as a happy portent of the advent of good government or the
birth of men who are to prove virtuous rulers. It has the body of a
deer, the tail of an ox, and a single, soft horn. As messenger of
mercy and benevolence, the Kirin never treads on a live insect or
eats growing grass. Later philosophy made this imaginary beast the
incarnation of those five primordial elements&mdash;earth, air,
water, fire and ether of which all things, including man's body,
are made and which are symbolized in the shapes of the cube, globe,
pyramid, saucer and tuft of rays in the Japanese gravestones. It is
said to attain the age of a thousand years, to be the noblest form
of the animal creation and the emblem of perfect good. In Chinese
and Japanese art this creature holds a prominent place, and in
literature even more so. It is not only part of the repertoire of
the artist's symbols in the Chinese world of ideas, but is almost a
necessity to the moulds of thought in eastern Asia. Yet it is older
than Confucius or the book-religions, and its conception shows one
of the nobler sides of Animism.</p>
<p>The Feng-hwang or Phoenix, Japanese H[=o]-w[=o], the second of
the incarnations of the spirits, is of wondrous form and mystic
nature. The rare advent of this bird upon the earth is, like that
of the kirin or unicorn, a presage of the advent of virtuous rulers
and good government. It has the head of a pheasant, the beak of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>{19}</span>
a swallow, the neck of a tortoise, and the features of the dragon
and fish. Its colors and streaming feathers are gorgeous with
iridian sheen, combining the splendors of the pheasant and the
peacock. Its five colors symbolize the cardinal virtues of
uprightness of mind, obedience, justice, fidelity and benevolence.
The male bird <i>H[=o]</i>, and female <i>w[=o]</i>, by their
inseparable fellowship furnish the artist, poet and literary writer
with the originals of the ten thousand references which are found
in Chinese and its derived literatures. Of this mystic Phoenix a
Chinese dictionary thus gives description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Phoenix is of the essence of water; it was born in the
vermilion cave; it perches not but on the most beautiful of all
trees; it eats not but of the seed of the bamboo; its body is
adorned with the five colors; its song contains the five notes; as
it walks it looks around; as it flies hosts of birds follow it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Older than the elaborate descriptions of it and its
representations in art, the H[=o]-w[=o] is one of the creations of
primitive Chinese Animism.</p>
<p>The Kwei or Tortoise is not the actual horny reptile known to
naturalists and to common experience, but a spirit, an animated
creature that ages ago rose up out of the Yellow River, having on
its carapace the mystic writing out of which the legendary founder
of Chinese civilization deciphered the basis of moral teachings and
the secrets of the unseen. From this divine tortoise which
conceived by thought alone, all other tortoises sprang. In the
elaboration of the myths and legends concerning the tortoise we
find many varieties of this scaly incarnation. It lives a thousand
years, hence it is emblem of longevity in art and literature. It is
the attendant of the god of the waters. It has <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>{20}</span> some of the
qualities and energies of the dragon, it has the power of
transformation. In pictures and sculptures we are familiar with its
figure, often of colossal size, as forming the curb of a well, the
base of a monument or tablet. Yet, whatever its form in literature
or art, it is the later elaborated representation of ancient
Animism which selected the tortoise as one of the manifold
incarnations or media of the myriad spirits that populate the
air.</p>
<p>Chief and leader of the four divinely constituted beasts is the
Lung, Japanese Ri[=o], or Dragon, which has the power of
transformation and of making itself visible or invisible. At will
it reduces itself to the size of a silk-worm, or is swollen until
it fills the space of heaven and earth. This is the creature
especially preeminent in art, literature and rhetoric. There are
nine kinds of dragons, all with various features and functions, and
artists and authors revel in their representation. The celestial
dragon guards the mansions of the gods and supports them lest they
fall; the spiritual dragon causes the winds to blow and rain to
descend for the service of mankind; the earth dragon marks out the
courses of rivers and streams; the dragon of the hidden treasures
watches over the wealth concealed from mortals, etc. Outwardly, the
dragon of superstition resembles the geological monsters brought to
resurrection by our paleontologists. He seems to incarnate all the
attributes and forces of animal life&mdash;vigor, rapidity of
motion, endurance, power of offence in horn, hoof, claw, tooth,
nail, scale and fiery breath. Being the embodiment of all force the
dragon is especially symbolical of the emperor. Usually associated
with malevolence, one sees, besides the conventional art and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>{21}</span>
literature of civilization, the primitive animistic idea of men to
whose mind this mysterious universe had no unity, who believed in
myriad discordant spirits but knew not of "one Law-giver, who is
able both to save and to destroy." An enlargement, possibly, of
prehistoric man's reminiscence of now extinct monsters, the dragon
is, in its artistic development, a mythical embodiment of all the
powers of moisture to bless and to harm. We shall see how, when
Buddhism entered China, the cobra-de-capello, so often figured in
the Buddhistic representations of India, is replaced by the
dragon.</p>
<p>Yet besides these four incarnations of the spirits that misrule
the world there is a host, a menagerie of mythical monsters. In
Korea, one of the Asian countries richest in demonology, beast
worship is very prevalent. Mythical winged tigers and flying
serpents with attributes of fire, lightning and combinations of
forces not found in any one creature, are common to the popular
fancy. In Japan, the <i>kappa</i>, half monkey half tortoise, which
seizes children bathing in the rivers, as real to millions of the
native common folk as is the shark or porpoise; the flying-weasel,
that moves in the whirlwind with sickle-like blades on his claws,
which cut the face of the unfortunate; the wind-god or imp that
lets loose the gale or storm; the thunder-imp or hairy, cat-like
creature that on the cloud-edges beats his drums in crash, roll, or
rattle; the earthquake-fish or subterranean bull-head or cat-fish
that wriggles and writhes, causing the earth to shiver, shudder and
open; the <i>ja</i> or dragon centipede; the <i>tengu</i> or
long-nosed and winged mountain sprite, which acts as the messenger
of the gods, pulling out the tongues of fibbing, lying children;
besides the colossal spiders and <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page22" id="page22"></a>{22}</span> mythical creatures of the old
story-books; the foxes, badgers, cats and other creatures which
transform themselves and "possess" human beings, still influence
the popular mind. These, once the old <i>kami</i> of the primitive
Japanese, or <i>kamui</i> of the aboriginal Aino, show the mental
soil and climate<a id="footnotetag1-16" name=
"footnotetag1-16"></a><a href="#footnote1-16"><sup>16</sup></a>
which were to condition the growth of the seed imported from other
lands, whether of Buddhism or Christianity. It is very hard to kill
a god while the old mind that grew and nourished him still remains
the same. Banish or brand a phantom or mind-shadow once worshipped
as divine, and it will appear as a fairy, a demon, a mythical
animal, or an <i>oni</i>; but to annihilate it requires many
centuries of higher culture.</p>
<p>As with the superstitions and survival of Animism and Fetichism
from our pagan ancestors among ourselves, many of the lingering
beliefs may be harmless, but over the mass of men in Japan and in
Chinese Asia they still exert a baleful influence. They make life
full of distress; they curtail human joy; they are a hindrance, to
spiritual progress and to civilization.</p>
<h3>Fetichism.</h3>
<p>The animistic tendency in that part of Asia dominated by the
Chinese world of ideas shows itself not only in a belief in
messengers or embodiments of divine malevolence or benevolence, but
also in the location of the spiritual influence in or upon an
inanimate object or fetich. Among men in Chinese Asia, from the
clodhopper to the gentleman, the inheritance of Fetichism from the
primeval ages is constantly noticeable. Let us glance at the term
itself.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>{23}</span>
<p>As the Chinaman's "Joss" is only his own pronunciation of the
Portuguese word <i>Deos</i>, or the Latin <i>Deus</i>, so the word
"fetich" is but the Portuguese modification of the Latin word
<i>facticius</i>, that is <i>feiti&ccedil;o</i>. Portugal,
beginning nearly five hundred years ago, had the honor of sending
the first ships and crews to explore the coasts of Africa and Asia,
and her sailors by this word, now Englished as fetich, described
the native charms or talismans. The word "fetichism" came into the
European languages through the work of Charles de Brosses, who, in
1760, wrote on "Du Culte des Dieux F&eacute;tiches." In Fetichism,
the "object is treated as having personal consciousness and power,
is talked with, worshipped, prayed to, sacrificed to, petted or
ill-treated with reference to its past or future behavior to its
votaries."</p>
<p>Let me draw a picture from actual observation. I look out of the
windows of my house in Fukui. Here is a peasant who comes back
after the winter to prepare his field for cultivation. The man's
horizon of ideas, like his vocabulary, is very limited. His view of
actual life is bounded by a few rice-fields, a range of hills, and
the village near by. Possibly one visit to a city or large town has
enriched his experience. More probably, however, the wind and
clouds, the weather, the soil, crops and taxes, his family and food
and how to provide for them, are the main thoughts that occupy his
mind. Before he will strike mattock or spade in the soil, lay axe
to a tree, collect or burn underbrush, he will select a stone, a
slab of rock or a stick of wood, set it upon hill side or mud
field-boundary, and to this he will bow, prostrate himself or pray.
To him, this stone or stick is consecrated. It has power to placate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>{24}</span>
the spirits and ward off their evil. It is the medium of
communication between him and them. Now, having attended, as he
thinks, to the proprieties in the case, he proceeds to dig, plough,
drain, put in order and treat soil or water, tree or other growth
as is most convenient for his purpose. His fetich is erected to
"the honorable spirits." Were this not attended to, some known or
unknown bad luck, sinister fortune, or calamity would befall him.
Here, then, is a fetich-worshipper. The stick or stone is the
medium of communication between the man and the spirits who can
bless or harm him, and which to his mind are as countlessly
numerous as the swarms of mosquitoes which he drives out of and
away from his summer cottage by smudge fires in August.</p>
<p>One need not travel in Yezo or Saghalin to see practical
Fetichism. Go where you will in Japan, there are fetich
worshippers. Among the country folk, the "<i>inaka</i>" of Japanese
parlance, Fetichism is seen in its grossest forms. Yet among
probably millions of Buddhists, especially of certain sects, the
Nichiren for example, and even among the rationalistic Confucians,
there are fetich-worshippers. Rare is the Japanese farmer, laborer,
mechanic, ward-man, or <i>hei-min</i> of any trade who does not
wear amulet, charm or other object which he regards with more or
less of reverence as having relation to the powers that help or
harm.<a id="footnotetag1-17" name="footnotetag1-17"></a><a href=
"#footnote1-17"><sup>17</sup></a> In most of the Buddhist temples
these amulets are sold for the benefit of the priests or of the
shrine or monastery. Not a few even of the gentry consider it best
to be on the safe side and wear in pouch or purse these protectors
against evil.</p>
<p>Of the 7,817,570 houses in the empire, enumerated <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>{25}</span> in the
census of 1892, it is probable that seven millions of them are
subjects of insurance by fetich.<a id="footnotetag1-18" name=
"footnotetag1-18"></a><a href="#footnote1-18"><sup>18</sup></a>
They are guaranteed against fire, thieves, lightning, plague and
pestilence. It is because of money paid to the priests that the
wooden policies are duly nailed on the walls, and not on account of
the wise application of mathematical, financial or medical science.
Examine also the paper packages carefully tied and affixed above
the transom, decipher the writing in ink or the brand left by the
hot iron on the little slabs of pine-wood&mdash;there may be one or
a score of them&mdash;and what will you read? Names of the temples
with date of issue and seal of certificate from the priests,
mottoes or titles from sacred books, often only a Sanskrit letter
or monogram, of which the priest-pedler may long since have
forgotten the meaning. To build a house, select a cemetery or
proceed to any of the ordinary events of life without making use of
some sort of material fetich, is unusual, extraordinary and is
voted heterodox.</p>
<p>Long after the brutish stage of thought is past the fetichistic
instinct remains in the sacredness attached to the mere letter or
paper or parchment of the sacred book or writing, when used as
amulet, plaster or medicine. The survivals, even in Buddhism, of
ancient and prehistoric Fetichism are many and often with undenied
approval of the religious authorities, especially in those sects
which are themselves reversions to primitive and lower types of
religion.</p>
<p>Among the Ainos of Yezo and Saghalin the medicine-man or shaman
is decorated with fetichistic bric-&agrave;-brac of all sorts, and
these bits of shells, metals, and other clinking substances are
believed to be media of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id=
"page26"></a>{26}</span> communication with mysterious influences
and forces. In Korea thousands of trees bedecked with fluttering
rags, clinking scraps of tin, metal or stone signify the same
thing. In Japan these primitive tinkling scraps and clinking
bunches of glass have long since become the <i>suzu</i> or
wind-bells seen on the pagoda which tintinabulate with every
passing breeze. The whittled sticks of the Aino, non-conductors of
evil and protectors of those who make and rear them, stuck up in
every place of awe or supposed danger, have in the slow evolution
of centuries become the innumerable flag-poles, banners and
streamers which one sees at their <i>matsuris</i> or temple
festivals. Millions of towels and handkerchiefs still flutter over
wells and on sacred trees. In old Japan the banners of an army
almost outnumbered the men who fought beneath them. Today, at times
they nearly conceal the temples from view.</p>
<p>The civilized Japanese, having passed far beyond the Aino's
stage of religion, still show their fetichistic instincts in the
veneration accorded to priestly inventions for raising
revenue.<a id="footnotetag1-19" name="footnotetag1-19"></a><a href=
"#footnote1-19"><sup>19</sup></a> This instinct lingers in the
faith accorded to medicine in the form of decoction, pill, bolus or
poultice made from the sacred writing and piously swallowed; in the
reverence paid to the idol for its own sake, and in the charm or
amulet worn by the soldier in his cap or by the gentleman in his
pill-box, tobacco-pouch or purse.</p>
<p>As the will of the worshipper who selects the fetich makes it
what it is, so also, by the exercise of that will he imagines he
can in a certain measure be the equal or superior of his god. Like
the Italian peasant who beats or scolds his bambino when his
prayers are not <span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id=
"page27"></a>{27}</span> answered or his wishes gratified, so the
fetich is punished or not allowed to know what is going on, by
being covered up or hidden away. Instances of such rough handling
of their fetiches by the people are far from unknown in the Land of
Great Peace. At such childishness we may wonder and imagine that
fetich-worship is the very antipodes of religion; and yet it
requires but little study of the lower orders of mind and conduct
in Christendom to see how fetich-worship still lingers among people
called Christians, whether the fetich be the image of a saint or
the Virgin, or a verse of the Bible found at random and used much
as is a penny-toss to decide minor actions. Or, to look farther
south, what means the rabbit's foot carried in the pocket or the
various articles of faith now hanging in the limbo between religion
and folk-lore in various parts of our own country?</p>
<h3>Phallicism.</h3>
<p>Further illustrations of far Eastern Animism and Fetichism are
seen in forms once vastly more prevalent in Japan than now. Indeed,
so far improved off the face of the earth are they, that some are
already matters of memory or arch&aelig;ology, and their very
existence even in former days is nearly or wholly incredible to the
generation born since 1868&mdash;when Old Japan began to vanish in
dissolving views and New Japan to emerge. What the author has seen
with his own eyes, would amaze many Japanese born since 1868 and
the readers of the rhapsodies of tourists who study Japan from the
<i>jin-riki-sha</i>. Phases of tree and serpent worship are still
quite common, and will be probably for generations <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>{28}</span> to come; but
the phallic shrines and emblems abolished by the government in 1872
have been so far invisible to most living travellers and natives,
that their once general existence and use are now scarcely
suspected. Even profound scholars of the Japanese language and
literature whose work dates from after the year 1872 have scarcely
suspected the universality of phallic worship. Yet what we could
say of this cult and its emblems, especially in treating of
Shint[=o], the special ethnic faith of Japan, would be from sight
of our own eyes besides the testimony of many witnesses.<a id=
"footnotetag1-20" name="footnotetag1-20"></a><a href=
"#footnote1-20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>The cultus has been known in the Japanese archipelago from Riu
Kin to Yezo. Despite official edicts of abolition it is still
secretly practised by the "heathen," the <i>inaka</i> of Japan.
"Government law lasts three days," is an ancient proverb in Nippon.
Sharp eyes have, within three months of the writing of this line,
unearthed a phallic shrine within a stone's-throw of Shint[=o]'s
most sacred temples at Is&eacute;. Formerly, however, these
implements of worship were seen numerously&mdash;in the cornucopia
distributed in the temples, in the <i>matsuris</i> or religious
processions and in representation by various plastic
material&mdash;and all this until 1872, to an extent that is
absolutely incredible to all except the eye-witnesses, some of
whose written testimonies we possess. What seems to our mind
shocking and revolting was once a part of our own ancestors' faith,
and until very recently was the perfectly natural and innocent
creed of many millions of Japanese and is yet the same for tens of
thousands of them.</p>
<p>We may easily see why and how that which to us is a degrading
cult was not only closely allied to Shint[=o], <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>{29}</span> but directly
fostered by and properly a part of it, as soon as we read the
account of the creation of the world, an contained in the national
"Book of Ancient Traditions," the "Kojiki." Several of the opening
paragraphs of this sacred book of Shint[=o] are phallic myths
explaining cosmogony. Yet the myths and the cult are older than the
writing and are phases of primitive Japanese faith. The mystery of
fatherhood is to the primitive man the mystery of creation also. To
him neither the thought nor the word was at hand to put difference
and transcendental separation between him and what he worshipped as
a god.</p>
<p>Into the details of the former display and carriage of these now
obscene symbols in the popular celebrations; of the behavior of
even respectable citizens during the excitement and frenzy of the
festivals; of their presence in the wayside shrines; of the
philosophy, hideousness or pathos of the subject, we cannot here
enter. We simply call attention to their existence, and to a form
of thought, if not of religion, properly so-called, which has
survived all imported systems of faith and which shows what the
native or indigenous idea of divinity really is&mdash;an idea that
profoundly affects the organization of society. To the enlightened
Buddhist, Confucian, and even the modern Shintoist the
phallus-worshipper is a "heathen," a "pagan," and yet he still
practises his faith and rites. It is for us to hint at the powerful
influence such persistent ideas have upon Japanese morals and
civilization. Still further, we illustrate the basic fact which all
foreign religions and all missionaries, Confucian, Buddhist,
Mahometan or Christian must deal with, viz.: That the Eastern
Asiatic mind runs to pantheism <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page30" id="page30"></a>{30}</span> as surely as the body of flesh
and blood seeks food.</p>
<h3>Tree and Serpent Worship.</h3>
<p>In prehistoric and medieval Japan, as among the Ainos to-day,
trees and serpents as well as rocks, rivers and other inanimate
objects were worshipped, because such of them as were supposed for
reasons known and felt to be awe-inspiring or wonderful were
"kami," that is, above the common, wonderful.<a id=
"footnotetag1-21" name="footnotetag1-21"></a><a href=
"#footnote1-21"><sup>21</sup></a> This word kami is usually
translated god or deity, but the term does not conform to our
ideas, by a great gulf of difference. It is more than probable that
the Japanese term kami is the same as the Aino word <i>kamui</i>,
and that the despised and conquered aboriginal savage has furnished
the mould of the ordinary Japanese idea of god&mdash;which even
to-day with them means anything wonderful or extraordinary.<a id=
"footnotetag1-22" name="footnotetag1-22"></a><a href=
"#footnote1-22"><sup>22</sup></a> From the days before history the
people have worshipped trees, and do so yet, considering them as
the abodes of and as means of communication with supernatural
powers. On them the people hang their votive offerings, twist on
the branches their prayers written on paper, avoid cutting down,
breaking or in any way injuring certain trees. The <i>sakaki</i>
tree is especially sacred, even to this day, in funeral or
Shint[=o] services. To wound or defile a tree sacred to a
particular god was to call forth the vengeance of the insulted
deity upon the insulter, or as the hearer of prayer upon another to
whom guilt was imputed and punishment was due.</p>
<p>Thus, in the days older than this present generation, but still
within this century, as the writer has witnessed, it was the custom
of women betrayed by <span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id=
"page31"></a>{31}</span> their lovers to perform the religious act
of vengeance called <i>Ushi toki mairi</i>, or going to the temple
at the hour of the ox, that is at 2 A.M. First making an image or
manikin of straw, she set out on her errand of revenge, with nails
held in her mouth and with hammer in one hand and straw figure in
the other, sometimes also having on her head a reversed tripod in
which were stuck three lighted candles. Arriving at the shrine she
selected a tree dedicated to a god, and then nailed the straw
simulacrum of her betrayer to the trunk, invoking the kami to curse
and annihilate the destroyer of her peace. She adjures the god to
save his tree, impute the guilt of desecration to the traitor and
visit him with deadly vengeance. The visit is repeated and nails
are driven until the object of the incantation sickens and dies, or
is at least supposed to do so. I have more than once seen such
trees and straw images upon them, and have observed others in which
the large number of rusted nails and fragments of straw showed how
tenaciously the superstition lingered.<a id="footnotetag1-23" name=
"footnotetag1-23"></a><a href="#footnote1-23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>In instances more pleasant to witness, may be seen trees
festooned with the symbolical rice-straw in cords and fringes. With
these the people honor the trees as the abode of the kami, or as
evidence of their faith in the renown accredited in the past.</p>
<p>In common with most human beings the Japanese consider the
serpent an object of mystery and awe, but most of them go further
and pay the ophidian a reverence and awe which is worship. Their
oldest literature shows how large a part the serpent played in the
so-called divine age, how it acted as progenitress of the Mikado's
ancestry, and how it afforded means <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page32" id="page32"></a>{32}</span> of incarnation for the kami or
gods. Ten species of ophidia are known in the Japanese islands, but
in the larger number of more or less imaginary varieties which
figure in the ancient books we shall find plenty of material for
fetich-worship. In perusing the "Kojiki" one scarcely knows, when
he begins a story, whether the character which to all appearance is
a man or woman is to end as a snake, or whether the mother after
delivering her child will or will not glide into the marsh or slide
away into the sea, leaving behind a trail of slime. A dragon is
three-fourths serpent, and both the dragon and the serpent are
prominent figures, perhaps the most prominent of the kami or gods
in human or animal form in the "Kojiki" and other early legends of
the gods, though the crocodile, crow, deer, dog, and other animals
are kami.<a id="footnotetag1-24" name=
"footnotetag1-24"></a><a href="#footnote1-24"><sup>24</sup></a> It
is therefore no wonder that serpents have been and are still
worshipped by the people, that some of their gods and goddesses are
liable at any time to slip away in scaly form, that famous temples
are built on sites noted as being the abode or visible place of the
actual water or land snake of natural history, and that the spot
where a serpent is seen to-day is usually marked with a sacred
emblem or a shrine.<a id="footnotetag1-25" name=
"footnotetag1-25"></a><a href="#footnote1-25"><sup>25</sup></a> We
shall see how this snake-worship became not only a part of
Shint[=o] but even a notable feature in corrupt Buddhism.</p>
<h3>Pantheism's Destruction of Boundaries. <a id="footnotetag1-26"
name="footnotetag1-26"></a><a href=
"#footnote1-26"><sup>26</sup></a></h3>
<p>In its rudest forms, this pantheism branches out into animism or
shamanism, fetichism and phallicism. In its higher forms, it
becomes polytheism, idolatry and defective philosophy. Having
centuries ago corrupted <span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id=
"page33"></a>{33}</span> Buddhism it is the malaria which, unseen
and unfelt, is ready to poison and corrupt Christianity. Indeed, it
has already given over to disease and spiritual death more than one
once hopeful Christian believer, teacher and preacher in the Japan
of our decade.</p>
<p>To assault and remove the incubus, to replace and refill the
mind, to lift up and enlighten the Japanese peasant, science as
already known and faith in one God, Creator and Father of all
things, must go hand in hand. Education and civilization will do
much for the ignorant <i>inaka</i> or boors, but for the cultured
whose minds waver and whose feet flounder, as well as for the
unlearned and priest-ridden, there is no surer help and healing
than that faith in the Heavenly Father which gives the unifying
thought to him who looks into creation.</p>
<p>Keep the boundary line clear between God and his world and all
is order and discrimination. Obliterate that boundary and all is
pathless morass, black chaos and on the mind the phantasms which
belong to the victim of <i>delirium tremens</i>.</p>
<p>There is one Lawgiver. In the beginning, God. In the end, God,
all in all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II - SHINT[=O]: MYTHS AND RITUAL</h2>
<h3>The Japanese a Young Nation.</h3>
<p>What impresses us in the study of the history of Japan is that,
compared with China and Korea, she is young. Her history is as the
story of yesterday. The nation is modern. The Japanese are as
younger children in the great family of Asia's historic people.
Broadly speaking, Japan is no older than England, and authentic
Japanese history no more ancient than British history. In Albion,
as in the Honorable Country, there are traditions and mythologies
that project their shadows aeons back of genuine records; but if we
consider that English history begins in the fifth, and English
literature in the eighth century, then there are other reasons
besides those commonly given for calling Japan "the England of the
East."</p>
<p>No trustworthy traditions exist which carry the known history of
Japan farther back than the fifth century. The means for measuring
and recording time were probably not in use until the sixth
century. The oldest documents in the Japanese language, excepting a
few fragments of the seventh century, do not antedate the year 712,
and even in these the Chinese characters are in many instances used
phonetically, because the meaning of the words thus transliterated
had <span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id=
"page38"></a>{38}</span> already been forgotten. Hence their
interpretation in detail is still largely a matter of
conjecture.</p>
<p>Yet the Japanese Archipelago was inhabited long before the dawn
of history. The concurrent testimony of the earliest literary
monuments, of the indigenous mythology, of folk-lore, of
shell-heaps and of kitchen-middens shows that the occupation by
human beings of the main islands must be ascribed to times long
before the Christian era. Before written records or ritual of
worship, religion existed on its active or devotional side, and
there were mature growths of thought preserved and expressed
orally. Poems, songs, chants and <i>norito</i> or liturgies were
kept alive in the human memory, and there was a system of worship,
the <i>name</i> of which was given long after the introduction of
Buddhism. This descriptive term, Kami no Michi in Japanese, and
Shin-t[=o] in the Chinese as pronounced by Japanese, means the Way
of the Gods, the t[=o] or final syllable being the same as tao in
Taoism. We may say that Shint[=o] means, literally, theoslogos,
theology. The customs and practices existed centuries before
contact with Chinese letters, and long previous to the Shint[=o]
literature which is now extant.</p>
<p>Whether Kami no Michi is wholly the product of Japanese soil, or
whether its rudimentary ideas were imported from the neighboring
Asian continent and more or less allied to the primitive Chinese
religion, is still an open question. The preponderance of argument
tends, however, to show that it was an importation as to its
origin, for not a few events outlined in the Japanese mythology
cast shadows of reminiscence upon Korea or the Asian mainland. In
its development, however, the cultus is almost wholly Japanese.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>{39}</span>
The modern forms of Shint[=o], as moulded by the revivalists of the
eighteenth century, are at many points notably different from the
ancient faith. At the World's Parliament of Religions at Chicago,
Shint[=o] seemed to be the only one, and probably the last, of the
purely provincial religions.</p>
<p>In order to gain a picture of life in Japan before the
introduction of Chinese civilization, we must consult those
photographs of the minds of the ancient islanders which still exist
in their earliest literature. The fruits of the study of ethnology,
anthropology and archaeology greatly assist us in picturing the
day-break of human life in the Morning Land. In preparing materials
for the student of the religions of Japan many laborers have
wrought in various fields, but the chief literary honors have been
taken by the English scholars, Messrs. Satow,<a id="footnotetag2-1"
name="footnotetag2-1"></a><a href="#footnote2-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
Aston,<a id="footnotetag2-2" name="footnotetag2-2"></a><a href=
"#footnote2-2"><sup>2</sup></a> and Chamberlain.<a id=
"footnotetag2-3" name="footnotetag2-3"></a><a href=
"#footnote2-3"><sup>3</sup></a> These untiring workers have opened
the treasures of ancient thought in the Altaic world.<a id=
"footnotetag2-4" name="footnotetag2-4"></a><a href=
"#footnote2-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Although even these archaic Japanese compositions, readable
to-day only by special scholars, are more or less affected by
Chinese influences, ideas and modes of expression, yet they are in
the main faithful reflections of the ancient life before the
primitive faith of the Japanese people was either disturbed or
reduced to system in presence of an imported religion. These
monuments of history, poetry and liturgies are the "Kojiki," or
Notices of Ancient Things; the "Many&ouml;shu" or Myriad Leaves or
Poems, and the "Norito," or Liturgies.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>{40}</span>
<h3>The Ancient Documents.</h3>
<p>The first book, the "Kojiki," gives us the theology, cosmogony,
mythology, and very probably, in its later portions, some outlines
of history of the ancient Japanese. The "Kojiki" is the real, the
dogmatic exponent, or, if we may so say, the Bible, of Shint[=o].
The "Many[=o]shu," or Book of Myriad Poems, expresses the thoughts
and feelings; reflects the manners and customs of the primitive
generations, and, in the same sense as do the Sagas of the
Scandinavians, furnishes us unchronological but interesting and
more or less real narratives of events which have been glorified by
the poets and artists. The ancient codes of law and of ceremonial
procedure are of great value, while the "Norito" are excellent
mirrors in which to see reflected the religion called Shint[=o] on
the more active side of worship.</p>
<p>In a critical study, either of the general body of national
tradition or of the ancient documents, we must continually be on
our guard against the usual assumption that Chinese civilization
came in earlier than it really did. This assumption colors all
modern Japanese popular ideas, art and literature. The vice of the
pupil nations surrounding the Middle Kingdom is their desire to
have it believed that Chinese letters and culture among them is an
nearly coeval with those of China as can be made truly or falsely
to appear. The Koreans, for example, would have us believe that
their civilization, based on letters and introduced by Kishi, is
"four thousand years old" and contemporaneous with China's own, and
that "the Koreans are among the oldest people of the world."<a id=
"footnotetag2-5" name="footnotetag2-5"></a><a href=
"#footnote2-5"><sup>5</sup></a> The average modern <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>{41}</span> Japanese
wishes the date of authentic or official history projected as far
back as possible. Yet he is a modest man compared with his
medi&aelig;val ancestor, who constructed chronology out of
ink-stones. Over a thousand years ago a deliberate forgery was
officially put on paper. A whole line of emperors who never lived
was canonized, and clever penmen set down in ink long chapters
which describe what never happened.<a id="footnotetag2-6" name=
"footnotetag2-6"></a><a href="#footnote2-6"><sup>6</sup></a>
Furthermore, even after, and only eight years after the fairly
honest "Kojiki" had been compiled, the book called "Nihongi," or
Chronicles of Japan, was written. All the internal and not a little
external evidence shows that the object of this book is to give the
impression that Chinese ideas, culture and learning had long been
domesticated in Japan. The "Nihongi" gives dates of events supposed
to have happened fifteen hundred years before, with an accuracy
which may be called villainous; while the "Kojiki" states that
Wani, a Korean teacher, brought the "Thousand Character Classic" to
Japan in A.D. 285, though that famous Chinese book was not composed
until the sixth century, or A.D. 550.<a id="footnotetag2-7" name=
"footnotetag2-7"></a><a href="#footnote2-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Even to this day it is nearly impossible for an American to get
a Korean "frog in the well"<a id="footnotetag2-8" name=
"footnotetag2-8"></a><a href="#footnote2-8"><sup>8</sup></a> to
understand why the genuine native life and history, language and
learning of his own peninsular country is of greater value to the
student than the pedantry borrowed from China. Why these possess
any interest to a "scholar" is a mystery to the head in the
horsehair net. Anything of value, he thinks, <i>must</i> be on the
Chinese model. What is not Chinese is foolish and fit for women and
children only. Furthermore, Korea "always had" Chinese learning.
This is the sum of the arguments <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page42" id="page42"></a>{42}</span> of the Korean literati, even
as it used to be of the old-time hatless Yedo scholar of shaven
skull and topknot.</p>
<p>Despite Japanese independence and even arrogance in certain
other lines, the thought of the demolition of cherished notions of
vast antiquity is very painful. Critical study of ancient
traditions is still dangerous, even in parliamentary Nippon. Hence
the unbiassed student must depend on his own reading of and
judgment upon the ancient records, assisted by the thorough work
done by the English scholars Aston, Satow, Chamberlain, Bramsen and
others.</p>
<p>It was the coming of Buddhism in the sixth century, and the
implanting on the soil of Japan of a system of religion in which
were temples with all that was attractive to the eye, gorgeous
ritual, scriptures, priesthood, codes of morals, rigid discipline,
a system of dogmatics in which all was made positive and clear,
that made the variant myths and legends somewhat uniform. The faith
of Shaka, by winning adherents both at the court and among the
leading men of intelligence, reacted upon the national traditions
so as to compel their collection and arrangemeut into definite
formulas. In due time the mythology, poetry and ritual was, as we
have seen, committed to writing and the whole system called
Shint[=o], in distinction from Butsud[=o], the Way of the Gods from
the Way of the Buddhas. Thus we can see more clearly the outward
and visible manifestations of Shint[=o]. In forming our judgment,
however, we must put aside those descriptions which are found in
the works of European writers, from Marco Polo and Mendez Pinto
down to the year 1870. Though these were good observers, they were
often necessarily mistaken in their deductions. For, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>{43}</span> as we shall
see in our lecture on Riy[=o]bu or Mixed Buddhism, Shint[=o] was,
from the ninth century until late into the nineteenth century,
absorbed in Buddhism so as to be next to invisible.</p>
<h3>Origins of the Japanese People.</h3>
<p>Without detailing processes, but giving only results, our view
of the origin of the Japanese people and of their religion is in
the main as follows:</p>
<p>The oldest seats of human habitation in the Japanese Archipelago
lie between the thirtieth and thirty-eighth parallels of north
latitude. South of the thirty-fourth parallel, it seems, though
without proof of writing or from tradition, that the Malay type and
blood from the far south probably predominated, with, however, much
infusion from the northern Asian mainland.</p>
<p>Between the thirty-fourth and thirty-sixth parallels, and west
of the one hundred and thirty-eighth meridian of longitude, may be
found what is still the choicest, richest and most populous part of
The Country Between Heaven and Earth. Here the prevailing element
was Korean and Tartar.</p>
<p>To the north and east of this fair country lay the Emishi
savages, or Ainos.</p>
<p>In "the world" within the ken of the prehistoric dwellers in
what is now the three islands, Hondo, Kiushiu and Shikoku, there
was no island of Yezu and no China; while Korea was but slightly
known, and the lands farther westward were unheard of except as the
home of distant tribes.</p>
<p>Three distinct lines of tradition point to the near <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>{44}</span> peninsula or
the west coast of Japan as the "Heaven" whence descended the tribe
which finally grew to be dominant. The islands of Tsushima and Iki
were the stepping-stones of the migration out of which rose what
may be called the southern or Tsukushi cycle of legend, Tsukushi
being the ancient name of Kiushiu.</p>
<p>Idzumo is the holy land whence issued the second stream of
tradition.</p>
<p>The third course of myth and legend leads us into Yamato, whence
we behold the conquest of the Mikado's home-land and the extension
of his name and influence into the regions east of the
Hakon&eacute; Mountains, including the great plain of Yedo, where
modern T[=o]ki[=o] now stands.</p>
<p>We shall take the term "Yamato" as the synonym of the
prehistoric but discernible beginnings of national life. It
represents the seat of the tribe whose valor and genius ultimately
produced the Mikado system. It was through this house or tribe that
Japanese history took form. The reverence for the ruler long
afterward entitled "Son of Heaven" is the strongest force in the
national history. The spirit and prowess of these early conquerors
have left an indelible impress upon the language and the mind of
the nation in the phrase Yamato Damashi&mdash;the spirit of (Divine
and unconquerable) Japan.</p>
<p>The story of the conquest of the land, in its many phases,
recalls that of the Aryans in India, of the Hebrews in Canaan, of
the Romans in Europe and of the Germanic races in North America.
The Yamato men gradually advanced to conquest under the impulse, as
they believed, of a divine command.<a id="footnotetag2-9" name=
"footnotetag2-9"></a><a href="#footnote2-9"><sup>9</sup></a> They
were sent from Takama-no-hara, the High Plain of Heaven.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>{45}</span>
Theirs was the war, of men with a nobler creed, having agriculture
and a feudal system of organization which furnished resources for
long campaigns, against hunters and fishermen. They had improved
artillery and used iron against stone. Yet they conquered and
pacified not only by superior strategy, tactics, weapons and valor,
but also by advanced fetiches and dogma. They captured the religion
of their enemies as well as their bodies, lands and resources. They
claimed that their ancestors were from Heaven, that the Sun was
their kinswoman and that their chief, or Mikado, was vicegerent of
the Heavenly gods, but that those whom they conquered were
earth-born or sprung from the terrestrial divinities.</p>
<h3>Mikadoism the Heart of Shint[=o].</h3>
<p>As success came to their arms and their chief's power was made
more sure, they developed further the dogma of the Mikado's
divinity and made worship centre in him as the earthly
representative of the Sun and Heaven. His fellow-conquerors and
ministers, as fast as they were put in lordship over conquered
provinces, or indigenous chieftains who submitted obediently to his
sway or yielded graciously to his prowess, were named as founders
of temples and in later generations worshipped and became
gods.<a id="footnotetag2-10" name="footnotetag2-10"></a><a href=
"#footnote2-10"><sup>10</sup></a> One of the motives for, and one
of the guiding principles in the selections of the floating myths,
was that the ancestry of the chieftains loyal to the Mikado might
be shown to be from the heavenly gods. Both the narratives of the
"Kojiki" and the liturgies show this clearly.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>{46}</span>
<p>The nature-worship, which was probably practised throughout the
whole archipelago, became part of the system as government and
society were made uniform on the Yamato model. It seems at least
possible, if Buddhism had not come in so soon, that the ordinary
features of a religion, dogmatic and ethical codes, would have been
developed. In a word, the Kami no Michi, or religion of the
islanders in prehistoric times before the rise of Mikadoism, must
be carefully distinguished from the politico-ecclesiasticism which
the system called Shint[=o] reveals and demands. The early
religion, first in the hands of politicians and later under the
pens and voices of writers and teachers at the Imperial Court,
became something very different from its original form. As surely
as K[=o]b[=o] later captured Shint[=o], making material for
Buddhism out of it and overlaying it in Riy[=o]bu, so the Yamato
men made political capital out of their own religion and that of
the subject tribes. The divine sovereign of Japan and his political
church did exactly what the state churches of Europe, both pagan
and Christian, have done before and since the Christian era.</p>
<p>Further, in studying the "Kojiki," we must remember that the
sacred writings sprang out of the religion, and that the system was
not an evolution from the book. Customs, ritual, faith and prayer
existed long before they were written about or recorded in ink.
Moreover, the philosophy came later than the practice, the deeds
before the myths, and the joy and terror of the visible universe
before the cosmogony or theogony, while the book-preface was
probably written last of all.</p>
<p>The sun was first, and then came the wonder, admiration and
worship of men. The personification and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>{47}</span> pedigree of
the sun were late figments. To connect their ancestors with the
sun-goddess and the heavenly gods, was a still later enterprise of
the "Mikado reverencers" of this earlier time. Both the god-way in
its early forms and Shint[=o] in its later development, were to
them political as well as ecclesiastical institutes of dogma. Both
the religion which they themselves brought and cultivated and the
aboriginal religion which the Yamato men found, were used as
engines in the making of Mikadoism, which is the heart of
Shint[=o].</p>
<p>Not until two centuries after the coming of Buddhism and of
Asiatic civilization did it occur to the Japanese to reduce to
writing the floating legends and various cycles of tradition which
had grown up luxuriantly in different parts of "the empire," or to
express in the Chinese character the prayers and thanksgivings
which had been handed down orally through many generations. These
norito had already assumed elegant literary form, rich in poetic
merit, long before Chinese writing was known. They, far more than
the less certain philosophy of the "Kojiki," are of undoubted
native origin. It is nearly certain that the prehistoric Japanese
did not borrow the literary forms of the god-way from China, as any
one familiar with the short, evenly balanced and antithetical
sentences of Chinese style can see at once. The norito are
expressions, in the rhythmical and rhetorical form of worship, of
the articles of faith set forth in the historic summary which we
have given. We propose to illustrate the dogmas by quoting from the
rituals in Mr. Satow's masterly translation. The following was
addressed to the sun-goddess (Amat&eacute;ras[)u] no Mikami, or the
From-Heaven-Shining-Great-Deity) <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page48" id="page48"></a>{48}</span> by the priest-envoy of the
priestly Nakatomi family sent annually to the temples at
Is&eacute;, the Mecca of Shint[=o]. The <i>sevran</i> referred to
in the ritual is the Mikado. This word and all the others printed
in capitals are so rendered in order to express in English the
force of "an untranslatable honorific syllable, supposed to be
originally identical with a root meaning 'true,' but no longer
possessing that signification." Instead of the word "earth," that
of "country" (Japan) is used as the correlative of Heaven.</p>
<h4>Ritual in Praise of the Sun-goddess.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>He (the priest-envoy) says: Hear all of you, ministers of the
gods and sanctifiers of offerings, the great ritual, the heavenly
ritual, declared in the great presence of the
From-Heaven-Shining-Great-DEITY, whose praises are fulfilled by
setting up the stout pillars of the great HOUSE, and exalting the
cross-beams to the plain of high heaven at the sources of the Isuzu
River at Uji in Watarai.</p>
<p>He says: It is the sovran's great WORD. Hear all of you,
ministers of the gods and sanctifiers of offerings, the fulfilling
of praises on this seventeenth day of the sixth moon of this year,
as the morning sun goes up in glory, of the Oho-Nakatomi,
who&mdash;having abundantly piled up like a range of hills the
TRIBUTE thread and sanctified LIQUOR and FOOD presented as of usage
by the people of the deity's houses attributed to her in the three
departments and in various countries and places, so that she deign
to bless his [the Mikado's] LIFE as a long LIFE, and his AGE as a
luxuriant AGE eternally and unchangingly as multitudinous piles of
rock; may deign to bless the CHILDREN who are born to him, and
deigning to cause to flourish the five kinds of grain which the men
of a hundred functions and the peasants of the countries in the
four quarters of the region under heaven long and peacefully
cultivate and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id=
"page49"></a>{49}</span> eat, and guarding and benefiting them to
deign to bless them&mdash;is hidden by the great
offering-wands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Imperial City the ritual services were very imposing.
Those in expectation of the harvest were held in the great hall of
the Jin-Gi-Kuan, or Council of the Gods of Heaven and Earth. The
description of the ceremonial is given by Mr. Satow.<a id=
"footnotetag2-11" name="footnotetag2-11"></a><a href=
"#footnote2-11"><sup>11</sup></a> In the prayers offered to the
sun-goddess for harvest, and in thanksgiving to her for bestowing
dominion over land and sea upon her descendant the Mikado, occurs
the following passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I declare in the great presence of the
From-Heaven-Shining-Great-DEITY who sits in Is&eacute;. Because the
sovran great GODDESS bestows on him the countries of the four
quarters over which her glance extends, as far as the limit where
heaven stands up like a wall, as far as the bounds where the
country stands up distant, as far as the limit where the blue
clouds spread flat, as far as the bounds where the white clouds lie
away fallen&mdash;the blue sea plain as far as the limit whither
come the prows of the ships without drying poles or paddles, the
ships which continuously crowd on the great sea plain, and the road
which men travel by land, as far as the limit whither come the
horses' hoofs, with the baggage-cords tied tightly, treading the
uneven rocks and tree-roots and standing up continuously in a long
path without a break&mdash;making the narrow countries wide and the
hilly countries plain, and as it were drawing together the distant
countries by throwing many tons of ropes over them&mdash;he will
pile up the first-fruits like a range of hills in the great
presence of the sovran great GODDESS, and will peacefully enjoy the
remainder.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Phallic Symbols.</h3>
<p>To form one's impression of the Kami no Michi wholly from the
poetic liturgies, the austere simplicity of the miyas or shrines,
or the worship at the palace or <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page50" id="page50"></a>{50}</span> capital, would be as
misleading as to gather our ideas of the status of popular
education from knowing only of the scholars at court. Among the
common people the real basis of the god-way was ancestor-worship.
From the very first this trait and habit of the Japanese can be
discerned. Their tenacity in holding to it made the Confucian
ethics more welcome when they came. Furthermore, this reverence for
the dead profoundly influenced and modified Buddhism, so that today
the altars of both religions exist in the same house, the dead
ancestors becoming both kami and buddhas.</p>
<p>Modern taste has removed from sight what were once the common
people's symbols of the god-way, that is of ancestor worship. The
extent of the phallus cult and its close and even vital connection
with the god-way, and the general and innocent use of the now
prohibited emblems, tax severely the credulity of the Occidental
reader. The processes of the ancient mind can hardly be understood
except by vigorous power of the imagination and by sympathy with
the primeval man. To the critical student, however, who has lived
among the people and the temples devoted to this worship, who knows
how innocent and how truly sincere and even reverent and devout in
the use of these symbols the worshippers are, the matter is
measurably clear. He can understand the soil, root and flower even
while the most strange specimen is abhorrent to his taste, and
while he is most active in destroying that mental climate in which
such worship, whether native or exotic, can exist and flourish.</p>
<p>In none of the instances in which I have been eyewitness of the
cult, of the person officiating or of the emblem, have I had any
reason to doubt the sincerity <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page51" id="page51"></a>{51}</span> of the worshipper. I have
never had reason to look upon the implements or the system as
anything else than the endeavor of man to solve the mystery of
Being and Power. In making use of these emblems, the Japanese
worshipper simply professes his faith in such solution as has
seemed to him attainable.</p>
<p>That this cultus was quite general in pre-Buddhistic Japan, as
in many other ancient countries, is certain from the proofs of
language, literature, external monuments and relics which are
sufficiently numerous. Its organic connection with the god-way may
be clearly shown.</p>
<p>To go farther back in point of time than the "Kojiki," we find
that even before the development of art in very ancient Japan, the
male gods were represented by a symbol which thus became an image
of the deity himself. This token was usually made of stone, though
often of wood, and in later times of terra-cotta, of cast and
wrought iron and even of gold.<a id="footnotetag2-12" name=
"footnotetag2-12"></a><a href="#footnote2-12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Under the direct influence of such a cult, other objects
appealed to the imagination or served the temporary purpose of the
worshipper as <i>ex-voto</i> to hang up in the shrines, such as the
mushroom, awabi, various other shells and possibly the fire-drill.
It is only in the decay of the cultus, in the change of view and
centre of thought compelled by another religion, that
representations of the old emblems ally themselves with sensualism
or immorality. It is that natural degradation of one man's god into
another man's devil, which conversion must almost of necessity
bring, that makes the once revered symbol "obscene," and talk about
it become, in a descending scale, dirty, foul, filthy, nasty. That
the Japanese suffer from the moral <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page52" id="page52"></a>{52}</span> effluvia of a decayed cult
which was once as the very vertebral column of the national body of
religion, is evident to every one who acquaints himself with their
popular speech and literature.</p>
<p>How closely and directly phallicism is connected with the
god-way, and why there were so many Shint[=o] temples devoted to
this latter cult and furnished with symbols, is shown by study of
the "Kojiki." The two opening sections of this book treat of kami
that were in the minds even of the makers of the myths little more
than mud and water<a id="footnotetag2-13" name=
"footnotetag2-13"></a><a href=
"#footnote2-13"><sup>13</sup></a>&mdash;the mere bioplasm of deity.
The seven divine generations are "born," but do nothing except that
they give Izanagi and Izanami a jewelled spear. With this pair come
differentiation of sex. It is immediately on the apparition of the
consciousness of sex that motion, action and creation begin, and
the progress of things visible ensues. The details cannot be put
into English, but it is enough, besides noting the conversation and
union of the pair, to say that the term meaning giving birth to,
refers to inanimate as well as animate things. It is used in
reference to the islands which compose the archipelago as well as
to the various kami which seem, in many cases, to be nothing more
than the names of things or places.</p>
<h3>Fire-myths and Ritual.</h3>
<p>Fire is, in a sense, the foundation and first necessity of
civilization, and it is interesting to study the myths as to the
origin of fire, and possibly even more interesting to compare the
Greek and Japanese stories. As we know, old-time popular etymology
makes Prometheus the fore-thinker and brother of Epimetheus the
after-thinker. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id=
"page53"></a>{53}</span> He is the stealer of the fire from heaven,
in order to make men share the secret of the gods. Comparative
philology tells us, however, that the Sanskrit <i>Pramantha</i> is
a stick that produces fire. The "Kojiki" does indeed contain what
is probably the later form of the fire-myth about two brothers,
Prince Fire-Shine and Fire-Fade, which suggests both the later
Greek myth of the fore- and after-thinker and a tradition of a
flood. The first, and most probably older, myth in giving the
origin of fire does it in true Japanese style, with details of
parturition. After numerous other deities had been born of Izanagi
and Izanami, it is said "that they gave birth to the
Fire-Burning-Swift-Male-Deity, another name for whom is the
Deity-Fire-Shining-Prince, and another name is the
Deity-Fire-Shining-Elder." In the other ancient literature this
fire-god is called Ho-musubi, the Fire-Producer.</p>
<p>Izanami yielded up her life upon the birth of her son, the
fire-god; or, as the sacred text declares, she "divinely
retired"<a id="footnotetag2-14" name="footnotetag2-14"></a><a href=
"#footnote2-14"><sup>14</sup></a> into Hades. From her corpse
sprang up the pairs of gods of clay, of metal, and other kami that
possessed the potency of calming or subduing fire, for clay resists
and water extinguishes. Between the mythical and the liturgical
forms of the original narrative there is considerable
variation.</p>
<p>The Norito entitled the "Quieting of Fire" gives the ritual form
of the myth. It contains, like so many Norito, less the form of
prayer to the Fire-Producer than a promise of offerings. Not so
much by petitions as by the inducements of gifts did the ancient
worshippers hope to save the palace of the Mikado from the
fire-god's wrath. We omit from the text those details which are
offensive to modern and western taste.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>{54}</span>
<blockquote>
<p>I declare with the great ritual, the heavenly ritual, which was
bestowed on him at the time when, by the WORD of the Sovran's dear
progenitor and progenitrix, who divinely remain in the plain of
high heaven, they bestowed on him the region under heaven,
saying:</p>
<p>"Let the Sovran GRANDCHILD'S augustness tranquilly rule over the
country of fresh spikes which flourishes in the midst of the
reed-moor as a peaceful region."</p>
<p>When ... Izanami ... had deigned to bear the many hundred
myriads of gods, she also deigned to bear her dear youngest child
of all, the Fire-producer god, ... and said:</p>
<p>"My dear elder brother's augustness shall rule the upper
country; I will rule the lower country," she deigned to hide in the
rocks; and having come to the flat hills of darkness, she thought
and said: "I have come hither, having borne and left a bad-hearted
child in the upper country, ruled over by my illustrious elder
brother's augustness," and going back she bore other children.
Having borne the water-goddess, the gourd, the river-weed, and the
clay-hill maiden, four sorts of things, she taught them with words,
and made them to know, saying: "If the heart of this bad-hearted
child becomes violent, let the water-goddess take the gourd, and
the clay-hill maiden take the river-weed, and pacify him."</p>
<p>In consequence of this I fulfil his praises, and say that for
the things set up, so that he may deign not to be awfully quick of
heart in the great place of the Sovran GRANDCHILD'S augustness,
there are provided bright cloth, glittering cloth, soft cloth, and
coarse cloth, and the five kinds of things; as to things which
dwell in the blue-sea plain, there are things wide of fin and
narrow of fin, down to the weeds of the shore; as to LIQUOR,
raising high the beer-jars, filling and ranging in rows the bellies
of the beer-jars, piling the offerings up, even to rice in grain
and rice in ear, like a range of hills, I fulfil his praises with
the great ritual, the heavenly ritual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Izanagi, after shedding tears over his consort, whose death was
caused by the birth of the fire-god, slays the fire-god, and
follows her into the Root-land, or Hades, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>{55}</span> whereupon
begins another round of wonderful stories of the birth of many
gods. Among these, though evidently out of another cycle of
legends, is the story of the birth of the three
gods&mdash;Fire-Shine, Fire-Climax and Fire-Fade, to which we have
already referred.</p>
<p>The fire-drill mentioned in the "Kojiki" suggests easily the
same line of thought with the myths of cosmogony and theogony, and
it is interesting to note that this archaic implement is still used
at the sacred temples of Is&eacute; to produce fire. After the
virgin priestesses perform the sacred dances in honor of local
deities the water for their bath is heated by fires kindled by
heaps of old <i>harai</i> or amulets made from temple-wood bought
at the Mecca of Japan. It is even probable that the retention of
the fire-drill in the service of Shint[=o] is but a survival of
phallicism.</p>
<p>The liturgy for the pacification of the gods of fire is worth
noticing. The full form of the ritual, when compared with a legend
in the "Nihongi," shows that a myth was "partly devised to explain
the connection of an hereditary family of priests with the god
whose shrine they served; it is possible that the claim to be
directly descended from the god had been disputed." The Norito
first recites poetically the descent of Ninigi, the grandchild of
the sun-goddess from heaven, and the quieting of the turbulent
kami.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I (the diviner), declare: When by the WORD of the progenitor and
progenitrix, who divinely remaining in the plain of high heaven,
deigned to make the beginning of things, they divinely deigned to
assemble the many hundred myriads of gods in the high city of
heaven, and deigned divinely to take counsel in council, saying:
"When we cause our Sovran GRANDCHILD'S augustness to leave heaven's
eternal seat, to cleave a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"
id="page56"></a>{56}</span> path with might through heaven's
manifold clouds, and to descend from heaven, with orders tranquilly
to rule the country of fresh spikes, which flourishes in the midst
of the reed-moor as a peaceful country, what god shall we send
first to divinely sweep away, sweep away and subdue the gods who
are turbulent in the country of fresh spikes;" all the gods
pondered and declared: "You shall send Am&eacute;nohohi's
augustness, and subdue them," declared they. Wherefore they sent
him down from heaven, but he did not declare an answer; and having
next sent Tak&eacute;mikuma's augustness, he also, obeying his
father's words, did not declare an answer. Am&eacute;-no-waka-hiko
also, whom they sent, did not declare an answer, but immediately
perished by the calamity of a bird on high. Wherefore they pondered
afresh by the WORD of the heavenly gods, and having deigned to send
down from heaven the two pillars of gods, Futsunushi and
Tak&eacute;mika-dzuchi's augustness, who having deigned divinely to
sweep away, and sweep away, and deigned divinely to soften, and
soften the gods who were turbulent, and silenced the rocks, trees,
and the least leaf of herbs likewise that had spoken, they caused
the Sovran GRANDCHILD'S augustness to descend from heaven.</p>
<p>I fulfil your praises, saying: As to the OFFERINGS set up, so
that the sovran gods who come into the heavenly HOUSE of the Sovran
GRANDCHILD'S augustness, which, after he had fixed upon as a
peaceful country&mdash;the country of great Yamato where the sun is
high, as the centre of the countries of the four quarters bestowed
upon him when he was thus sent down from heaven&mdash;stoutly
planting the HOUSE-pillars on the bottom-most rocks, and exalting
the cross-beams to the plain of high heaven, the builders had made
for his SHADE from the heavens and SHADE from the sun, and wherein
he will tranquilly rule the country as a peaceful
country&mdash;may, without deigning to be turbulent, deigning to be
fierce, and deigning to hurt, knowing, by virtue of their divinity,
the things which were begun in the plain of high heaven, deigning
to correct with Divine-correcting and Great-correcting, remove
hence out to the clean places of the mountain-streams which look
far away over the four quarters, and rule them as their own place.
Let the Sovran gods tranquilly take with clear HEARTS, as peaceful
OFFERINGS <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id=
"page57"></a>{57}</span> and sufficient OFFERINGS the great
OFFERINGS which I set up, piling them upon the tables like a range
of hills, providing bright cloth, glittering cloth, soft cloth, and
coarse cloth; as a thing to see plain in&mdash;a mirror: as things
to play with&mdash;beads: as things to shoot off with&mdash;a bow
and arrows: as a thing to strike and cut with&mdash;a sword: as a
thing which gallops out&mdash;a horse; as to LIQUOR&mdash;raising
high the beer-jars, filling and ranging in rows the bellies of the
beer-jars, with grains of rice and ears; as to the things which
dwell in the hills&mdash;things soft of hair, and things rough of
hair; as to the things which grow in the great field
plain&mdash;sweet herbs and bitter herbs; as to the things which
dwell in the blue sea plain&mdash;things broad of fin and things
narrow of fin, down to weeds of the offing and weeds of the shore,
and without deigning to be turbulent, deigning to be fierce, and
deigning to hurt, remove out to the wide and clean places of the
mountain-streams, and by virtue of their divinity be tranquil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this ritual we find the origin of evil attributed to wicked
kami, or gods. To get rid of them is to be free from the troubles
of life. The object of the ritual worship was to compel the
turbulent and malevolent kami to go out from human habitations to
the mountain solitudes and rest there. The dogmas of both
god-possession and of the power of exorcism were not, however, held
exclusively by the high functionaries of the official religion, but
were part of the faith of all the people. To this day both the
tenets and the practices are popular under various forms.</p>
<p>Besides the twenty-seven Norito which are found in the
Yengishiki, published at the opening of the tenth century, there
are many others composed for single occasions. Examples of these
are found in the Government Gazettes. One celebrates the Mikado's
removal from Ki[=o]to to T[=o]ki[=o], another was written and
recited to add greater solemnity to the oath which he took to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>{58}</span>
govern according to modern liberal principles and to form a
national parliament. To those Japanese whose first idea of duty is
loyalty to the emperor, Shint[=o] thus becomes a system of
patriotism exalted to the rank of a religion. Even Christian
natives of Japan can use much of the phraseology of the Norito
while addressing their petitions on behalf of their chief
magistrate to the King of kings.</p>
<p>The primitive worship of the sun, of light, of fire, has left
its impress upon the language and in vernacular art and customs.
Among scores of derivations of Japanese words (often more pleasing
than scientific), in which the general term <i>hi</i> enters, is
that which finds in the word for man, <i>hito</i>, the meaning of
"light-bearer." On the face of the broad terminal tiles of the
house-roofs, we still see moulded the river-weed, with which the
Clay-Hill Maiden pacified the Fire-God. On the frontlet of the
warrior's helmet, in the old days of arrow and armor, glittered in
brass on either side of his crest the same symbol of power and
victory.</p>

the teachings of its oldest book.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III - "THE KOJIKI" AND ITS TEACHINGS</h2>
<h3>"The Kojiki" mid its Myths of Cosmogony.</h3>
<p>As to the origin of the "Kojiki," we have in the closing
sentences of the author's preface the sole documentary authority
explaining its scope and certifying to its authenticity. Briefly
the statement is this: The "Heavenly Sovereign" or Mikado, Temmu
(A.D. 673-686), lamenting that the records possessed by the chief
families were "mostly amplified by empty falsehoods," and fearing
that "the grand foundation of the monarchy" would be destroyed,
resolved to preserve the truth. He therefore had the records
carefully examined, compared, and their errors eliminated. There
happened to be in his household a man of marvellous memory, named
Hiy&eacute;da Ar&eacute;, who could repeat, without mistake, the
contents of any document he had ever seen, and never forgot
anything which he had heard. This person was duly instructed in the
genuine traditions and old language of former ages, and made to
repeat them until he had the whole by heart. "Before the
undertaking was completed," which probably means before it could be
committed to writing, "the emperor died, and for twenty-five years
Ar&eacute;'s memory was the sole depository of what afterwards
received the title of 'Kojiki.' ... At the end of this interval the
Empress <span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id=
"page62"></a>{62}</span> Gemmi[=o] ordered Yasumar[=o] to write it
down from the mouth of Ar&eacute;, which accounts for the
completion of the manuscript in so short a time as four months and
a half,"<a id="footnotetag3-1" name="footnotetag3-1"></a><a href=
"#footnote3-1"><sup>1</sup></a> in A.D. 712.</p>
<p>It is from the "Kojiki" that we obtain most of our ideas of
ancient life and thought. The "Nihongi," or Chronicles of Japan,
expressed very largely in Chinese phrases and with Chinese
technical and philosophical terms, further assists us to get a
measurably correct idea of what is called The Divine Age. Of the
two books, however, the "Kojiki" is much more valuable as a true
record, because, though rude in style and exceedingly na&iuml;ve in
expression, and by no means free from Chinese thoughts and phrases,
it is marked by a genuinely Japanese cast of thought and method of
composition. Instead of the terse, carefully measured, balanced,
and antithetical sentences of correct Chinese, those of the
"Kojiki" are long and involved, and without much logical
connection. The "Kojiki" contains the real notions, feelings, and
beliefs of Japanese who lived before the eighth century.</p>
<p>Remembering that prefaces are, like porticos, usually added last
of all, we find that in the beginning all things were in chaos.
Heaven and earth were not separated. The world substance floated in
the cosmic mass, like oil on water or a fish in the sea. Motion in
some way began. The ethereal portions sublimed and formed the
heavens; the heavier residuum became the present earth. In the
plain of high heaven, when the heaven and earth began, were born
three kami who "hid their bodies," that is, passed away or died.
Out of the warm mould of the earth a germ sprouted, and from this
were born two kami, who also were born <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>{63}</span> alone, and
died. After these heavenly kami came forth what are called the
seven divine generations, or line of seven kami.<a id=
"footnotetag3-2" name="footnotetag3-2"></a><a href=
"#footnote3-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>To express the opening lines of the "Kojiki" in terms of our own
speech and in the moulds of Western thought, we may say that matter
existed before mind and the gods came forth, as it were, by
spontaneous evolution. The first thing that appeared out of the
warm earth-muck was like a rush-sprout, and this became a kami, or
god. From this being came forth others, which also produced beings,
until there were perfect bodies, sex and differentiation of powers.
The "Nihongi," however, not only gives a different view of this
evolution basing it upon the dualism of Chinese
philosophy&mdash;that is, of the active and passive
principles&mdash;and uses Chinese technical terminology, but gives
lists of kami that differ notably from those in the "Kojiki." This
latter fact seems to have escaped the attention of those who write
freely about what they imagine to be the early religion of the
Japanese.<a id="footnotetag3-3" name="footnotetag3-3"></a><a href=
"#footnote3-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>After this introduction, in which "Dualities, Trinities, and
Supreme Deities" have been discovered by writers unfamiliar with
the genius of the Japanese language, there follows an account of
the creation of the habitable earth by Izanami and Izanagi, whose
names mean the Male-Who-Invites and the Female-Who-Invites. The
heavenly kami commanded these two gods to consolidate and give
birth to the drifting land. Standing on the floating bridge of
heaven, the male plunged his jewel-spear into the unstable waters
beneath, stirring them until they gurgled and congealed. When he
drew forth the spear, the drops trickling from its point formed an
island, ever afterward <span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id=
"page64"></a>{64}</span> called Onokoro-jima, or the Island of the
Congealed Drop. Upon this island they descended. The creative pair,
or divine man and woman, now separated to make a journey round the
island, the male to the left, the female to the right. At their
meeting the female spoke first: "How joyful to meet a lovely man!"
The male, offended that the woman had spoken first, required the
circuit to be repeated. On their second meeting, the man cried out:
"How joyful to meet a lovely woman!" This island on which they had
descended was the first of several which they brought into being.
In poetry it is the Island of the Congealed Drop. In common
geography it is identified as Awaji, at the entrance of the Inland
Sea. Thence followed the creation of the other visible objects in
nature.</p>
<h3>Izanagi's Visit to Hades and Results.</h3>
<p>After the birth of the god of fire, which nearly destroyed the
mother's life, Izanami fled to the land of roots or of darkness,
that is into Hades. Izanagi, like a true Orpheus, followed his
Eurydice and beseeched her to come back to earth to complete with
him the work of creation. She parleyed so long with the gods of the
underworld that her consort, breaking off a tooth of his comb,
lighted it as a torch and rushed in. He found her putrefied body,
out of which had been born the eight gods of thunder. Horrified at
the awful foulness which he found in the underworld, he rushed up
and out, pursued by the Ugly-Female-of-Hades. By artifices that
bear a wonderful resemblance to those in Teutonic fairy tales, he
blocked up the way. His head-dress, thrown at his pursuer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>{65}</span>
turned into grapes which she stopped to eat. The teeth of his comb
sprouted into a bamboo forest, which detained her. The three
peaches were used as projectiles; his staff which stuck up in the
ground became a gate, and a mighty rock was used to block up the
narrow pass through the mountains. Each of these objects has its
relation to place-names in Idzumo or to superstitions that are
still extant. The peaches and the rocks became gods, and on this
incident, by which the beings in Hades were prevented from advance
and successful mischief on earth, is founded one of the norito
which Mr. Satow gives in condensed form. The names of the three
gods,<a id="footnotetag3-4" name="footnotetag3-4"></a><a href=
"#footnote3-4"><sup>4</sup></a> Youth and Maiden of the Many
Road-forkings, and Come-no-further Gate, are expressed and invoked
in the praises bestowed on them in connection with the
offerings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He (the priest) says: I declare in the presence of the sovran
gods, who like innumerable piles of rocks sit closing up the way in
the multitudinous road-forkings.... I fulfil your praises by
declaring your NAMES, Youth and Maiden of the Many Road-forkings
and Come-no-further Gate, and say: for the OFFERINGS set up that
you may prevent [the servants of the monarch] from being poisoned
by and agreeing with the things which shall come roughly-acting and
hating from the Root-country, the Bottom-country, that you may
guard the bottom (of the gate) when they come from the bottom,
guard the top when they come from the top, guarding with nightly
guard and with daily guard, and may praise them&mdash;peacefully
take the great OFFERINGS which are set up by piling them up like a
range of hills, that is to say, providing bright cloth, etc., ...
and sitting closing-up the way like innumerable piles of rock in
the multitudinous road-forkings, deign to praise the sovran
GRANDCHILD'S augustness eternally and unchangingly, and to bless
his age as a luxuriant AGE.</p>
</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>{66}</span>
<p>Retreating to another part of the world&mdash;that is, into
southwestern Japan&mdash;Izanami purified himself by bathing in a
stream. While washing himself,<a id="footnotetag3-5" name=
"footnotetag3-5"></a><a href="#footnote3-5"><sup>5</sup></a> many
kami were borne from the rinsings of his person, one of them, from
the left eye (the left in Japanese is always the honorable side),
being the far-shining or heaven-illuminating kami, whose name,
Amat&eacute;ras[)u], or Heaven-shiner, is usually translated "The
Sun-goddess." This personage is the centre of the system of
Shint[=o]. The creation of gods by a process of cleansing has had a
powerful effect on the Japanese, who usually associate cleanliness
of the body (less moral, than physical) with godliness.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to detail further the various stories which
make up the Japanese mythology. Some of these are lovely and
beautiful, but others are horrible and disgusting, while the
dominant note throughout is abundant filthiness.</p>
<p>Professor Basil Hall Chamberlain, who has done the world such
good service in translating into English the whole of the Kojiki,
and furnishing it with learned commentary and notes, has well
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The shocking obscenity of word and act to which the 'Records'
bear witness is another ugly feature which must not quite be passed
over in silence. It is true that decency, as we understand it, is a
very modern product, and it is not to be looked for in any society
in the barbarous stage. At the same time, the whole range of
literature might perhaps be ransacked for a parallel to the
na&iuml;ve filthiness of the passage forming Sec. IV. of the
following translation, or to the extraordinary topic which the hero
Yamato-Tak&eacute; and his mistress Miyadz[)u] are made to select
as the theme of poetical repartee. One passage likewise would lead
us to suppose that the most beastly crimes were commonly
committed."<a id="footnotetag3-6" name=
"footnotetag3-6"></a><a href="#footnote3-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>{67}</span>
<p>Indeed, it happens in several instances that the thread by which
the marvellous patchwork of unrelated and varying local myths is
joined together, is an indecent love story.</p>
<p>A thousand years after the traditions of the Kojiki had been
committed to writing, and orthodox Shint[=o] commentators had
learned science from the Dutch at Nagasaki, the stirring of the
world mud by Izanagi's spear<a id="footnotetag3-7" name=
"footnotetag3-7"></a><a href="#footnote3-7"><sup>7</sup></a> was
gravely asserted to be the cause of the diurnal revolution of the
earth upon its axis, the point of the axis being still the jewel
spear.<a id="footnotetag3-8" name="footnotetag3-8"></a><a href=
"#footnote3-8"><sup>8</sup></a> Onogoro-jima, or the Island of the
Congealed Drop, was formerly at the north pole,<a id=
"footnotetag3-9" name="footnotetag3-9"></a><a href=
"#footnote3-9"><sup>9</sup></a> but subsequently removed to its
present position. How this happened is not told.</p>
<h3>Life in Japan During the Divine Age.</h3>
<p>Now that the Kojiki is in English and all may read it, we can
clearly see who and what were the Japanese in the ages before
letters and Chinese civilization; for these stories of the kami are
but legendary and mythical accounts of men and women. One could
scarcely recognize in the islanders of eleven or twelve hundred
years ago, the polished, brilliant, and interesting people of
to-day. Yet truth compels us to say that social morals in Dai
Nippon, even with telegraphs and railways, are still more like
those of ancient days than readers of rhapsodies by summer tourists
might suppose. These early Japanese, indeed, were possibly in a
stage of civilization somewhat above that of the most advanced of
the American Indians when first met by Europeans, for they had a
rude system of agriculture and knew the art of fashioning iron into
tools and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id=
"page68"></a>{68}</span> weapons. Still, they were very barbarous,
certainly as much so as our Germanic "forbears." They lived in
huts. They were without writing or commerce, and were able to count
only to ten.<a id="footnotetag3-10" name=
"footnotetag3-10"></a><a href="#footnote3-10"><sup>10</sup></a>
Their cruelty was as revolting as that of the savage tribes of
America. The family was in its most rudimentary stage, with little
or no restraint upon the passions of men. Children of the same
father, but not of the same mother, could intermarry. The instances
of men marrying their sisters or aunts were very common. There was
no art, unless the making of clay images, to take the place of the
living human victims buried up to their necks in earth and left to
starve on the death of their masters,<a id="footnotetag3-11" name=
"footnotetag3-11"></a><a href="#footnote3-11"><sup>11</sup></a> may
be designated as such.</p>
<p>The Magatama, or curved jewels, being made of ground and
polished stone may be called jewelry; but since some of these
prehistoric ornaments dug up from the ground are found to be of
jade, a mineral which does not occur in Japan, it is evident that
some of these tokens of culture came from the continent. Many other
things produced by more or less skilled mechanics, the origin of
which is poetically recounted in the story of the dancing of
Uzum&eacute; before the cave in which the Sun-goddess had hid
herself,<a id="footnotetag3-12" name="footnotetag3-12"></a><a href=
"#footnote3-12"><sup>12</sup></a> were of continental origin.
Evidently these men of the god-way had passed the "stone age," and,
probably without going through the intermediate bronze age, were
artificers of iron and skilled in its use. Most of the names of
metals and of many other substances, and the terms used in the arts
and sciences, betray by their tell-tale etymology their Chinese
origin. Indeed, it is evident that some of the leading kami were
born in Korea or Tartary.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>{69}</span>
<p>Then as now the people in Japan loved nature, and were quickly
sensitive to her beauty and profoundly in sympathy with her varied
phenomena. In the medi&aelig;val ages, Japanese Wordsworths are not
unknown.<a id="footnotetag3-13" name="footnotetag3-13"></a><a href=
"#footnote3-13"><sup>13</sup></a> Sincerely they loved nature, and
in some respects they seemed to understand the character of their
country far better than the alien does or can. Though a land of
wonderful beauty, the Country of Peaceful Shores is enfolded in
powers of awful destructiveness. With the earthquake and volcano,
the typhoon and the tidal wave, beauty and horror alternate with a
swiftness that is amazing.</p>
<p>Probably in no portion of the earth are the people and the land
more like each other or apparently better acquainted with each
other. Nowhere are thought and speech more reflective of the
features of the landscape. Even after ten centuries, the Japanese
are, in temperament, what the Kojiki reveals them to have been in
their early simplicity. Indeed, just as the modern Frenchman, down
beneath his outward environments and his habiliments cut and fitted
yesterday, is intrinsically the same Gaul whom Julius C&aelig;sar
described eighteen hundred years ago, so the gentleman of
T[=o]ki[=o] or Ki[=o]to is, in his mental make-up, wonderfully like
his ancestors described by the first Japanese Stanley, who shed the
light of letters upon the night of unlettered Japan and darkest Dai
Nippon.</p>
<p>The Kojiki reveals to us, likewise, the childlike religious
ideas of the islanders. Heaven lay, not about but above them in
their infancy, yet not far away. Although in the "Notices," it is
"the high plain of heaven," yet it is just over their heads, and
once a single pillar joined it and the earth. Later, the idea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>{70}</span>
was, that it was held up by the pillar-gods of the wind, and to
them norito were recited. "The great plain of the blue sea" and
"the land of luxuriant reeds" form "the world"&mdash;which means
Japan. The gods are only men of prowess or renown. A kami is
anything wonderful&mdash;god or man, rock or stream, bird or snake,
whatever is surprising, sensational, or phenomenal, as in the
little child's world of to-day. There is no sharp line dividing
gods from men, the natural from the supernatural, even as with the
normal uneducated Japanese of to-day. As for the kami or gods, they
have all sorts of characters; some of them being rude and
ill-mannered, many of them beastly and filthy, while others are
noble and benevolent. The attributes of moral purity, wisdom and
holiness, cannot be, and in the original writings are not, ascribed
to them; but they were strong and had power. In so far as they had
power they were called kami or gods, whether celestial or
terrestrial. Among the kami&mdash;the one term under which they are
all included&mdash;there were heavenly bodies, mountains, rivers,
trees, rocks and animals, because those also were supposed to
possess force, or at least some kind of influence for good or evil.
Even peaches, as we have seen, when transformed into rocks, became
gods.<a id="footnotetag3-14" name="footnotetag3-14"></a><a href=
"#footnote3-14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>That there was worship with awe, reverence, and fear, and that
the festivals and sacrifices had two purposes, one of propitiating
the offended Kami and the other of purifying the worshipper, may be
seen in the norito or liturgies, some of which are exceedingly
beautiful.<a id="footnotetag3-15" name=
"footnotetag3-15"></a><a href="#footnote3-15"><sup>15</sup></a> In
them the feelings of the gods are often referred to. Sometimes
their characters are described. Yet one looks in vain in either the
"Notices," <span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id=
"page71"></a>{71}</span> poems, or liturgies for anything definite
in regard to these deities, or concerning morals or doctrines to be
held as dogmas. The first gods come into existence after evolution
of the matter of which they are composed has taken place. The later
gods are sometimes able to tell who are their progenitors,
sometimes not. They live and fight, eat and drink, and give vent to
their appetites and passions, and then they die; but exactly what
becomes of them after they die, the record does not state. Some are
in heaven, some on the earth, some in Hades. The underworld of the
first cycle of tradition is by no means that of the second.<a id=
"footnotetag3-16" name="footnotetag3-16"></a><a href=
"#footnote3-16"><sup>16</sup></a> Some of the kami are in the
water, or on the water, or in the air. As for man, there is no
clear statement as to whether he is to have any future life or what
is to become of him, though the custom or jun-shi, or dying with
the master, points to a sort of immortality such as the early
Greeks and the Iroquois believed in.</p>
<p>It would task the keenest and ablest Shint[=o]ist to deduce or
construct a system of theology, or of ethics, or of anthropology
from the mass of tradition so full of gaps and discord as that
found in the Kojiki, and none has done it. Nor do the inaccurate,
distorted, and often almost wholly factitious translations,
so-called, of French and other writers, who make versions which hit
the taste of their occidental readers far better than they express
the truth, yield the desired information. Like the end strands of a
new spider's web, the lines of information on most vital points are
still "in the air."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>{72}</span>
<h3>The Ethics of the God-way.</h3>
<p>There are no codes of morals inculcated in the god-way, for even
its modern revivalists and exponents consider that morals are the
invention of wicked people like the Chinese; while the ancient
Japanese were pure in thought and act. They revered the gods and
obeyed the Mikado, and that was the chief end of man, in those
ancient times when Japan was the world and Heaven was just above
the earth. Not exactly on Paul's principle of "where there is no
law there is no transgression," but utterly scouting the idea that
formulated ethics were necessary for these pure-minded people, the
modern revivalists of Shint[=o] teach that all that is "of faith"
now is to revere the gods, keep the heart pure, and follow its
dictates.<a id="footnotetag3-17" name=
"footnotetag3-17"></a><a href="#footnote3-17"><sup>17</sup></a> The
na&iuml;vet&eacute; of the representatives of Shint[=o] at Chicago
in A.D. 1893, was almost as great as that of the revivalists who
wrote when Japan was a hermit nation.</p>
<p>The very fact that there was no moral commandments, not even of
loyalty or obedience such as Confucianism afterward promulgated and
formulated, is proof to the modern Shint[=o]ist that the primeval
Japanese were pure and holy; they did right, naturally, and hence
he does not hesitate to call Japan, the Land of the Gods, the
Country of the Holy Spirits, the Region Between Heaven and Earth,
the Island of the Congealed Drop, the Sun's Nest, the Princess
Country, the Land of Great Peace, the Land of Great Gentleness, the
Mikado's Empire, the Country ruled by a Theocratic Dynasty. He
considers that only with the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"
id="page73"></a>{73}</span> vice brought over from the Continent of
Asia were ethics both imported and made necessary.<a id=
"footnotetag3-18" name="footnotetag3-18"></a><a href=
"#footnote3-18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>All this has been solemnly taught by famous Shint[=o] scholars
of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and is still
practically promulgated in the polemic Shint[=o] literature of
to-day, even after the Kojiki has been studied and translated into
European languages. The Kojiki shows that whatever the men may have
been or done, the gods were abominably obscene, and both in word
and deed were foul and revolting, utterly opposed in act to those
reserves of modesty or standards of shame that exist even among the
cultivated Japanese to-day.<a id="footnotetag3-19" name=
"footnotetag3-19"></a><a href="#footnote3-19"><sup>19</sup></a>
Even among the Ainos, whom the Japanese look upon as savages, there
is still much of the obscenity of speech which belongs to all
society<a id="footnotetag3-20" name="footnotetag3-20"></a><a href=
"#footnote3-20"><sup>20</sup></a> in a state of barbarism; but it
has been proved that genuine modesty is a characteristic of the
Aino women.<a id="footnotetag3-21" name=
"footnotetag3-21"></a><a href="#footnote3-21"><sup>21</sup></a> A
literal English translation of the Kojiki, however, requires an
abundant use of Latin in order to protect it from the grasp of the
law in English-speaking Christendom. In Chamberlain's version, the
numerous cesspools are thus filled up with a dead language, and the
road is constructed for the reader, who likes the language of
Edmund Spencer, of William Tyndale and of John Ruskin kept
unsoiled.</p>
<p>The cruelty which marks this early stage shows that though moral
codes did not exist, the Buddhist and Confucian missionary were for
Japan necessities of the first order. Comparing the result to-day
with the state of things in the early times, one must award high
praise to Buddhism that it has made the Japanese gentle, and to
Confucianism that it has taught the proprieties of life, so that
the polished Japanese gentleman, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page74" id="page74"></a>{74}</span> as to courtesy, is in many
respects the peer and at some external points the superior, of his
European confr&egrave;re.</p>
<p>Another fact, made repulsively clear, about life in ancient
Japan, is that the high ideals of truth and honor, characteristic
at least of the Samurai of modern times, were utterly unknown in
the days of the kami. Treachery was common. Instances multiply on
the pages of the Kojiki where friend betrayed friend. The most
sacred relations of life were violated. Altogether these were the
darkest ages of Japan, though, as among the red men of America,
there were not wanting many noble examples of stoical endurance, of
courage, and of power nobly exerted for the benefit of others.</p>
<h3>The Rise of Mikadoism.</h3>
<p>Nevertheless we must not forget that the men of the early age of
the Kami no Michi conquered the aborigines by superior dogmas and
fetiches, as well as by superior weapons. The entrance of these
heroes, invaders from the highlands of the Asian continent, by way
of Korea, was relatively a very influential factor of progress,
though not so important as was the Aryan descent upon India, or the
Norman invasion of England, for the aboriginal tribes were vastly
lower in the scale of humanity than their subduers. Where they
found savagery they introduced barbarism, which, though unlettered
and based on the sword, was a vast improvement over what may be
called the geological state of man, in which he is but slightly
raised above the brutes.</p>
<p>For the proofs from the shell heaps, combined with <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>{75}</span> the
reflected evidences of folk-lore, show, that cannibalism<a id=
"footnotetag3-22" name="footnotetag3-22"></a><a href=
"#footnote3-22"><sup>22</sup></a> was common in the early ages, and
that among the aboriginal hill tribes it lingered after the
inhabitants of the plain and shore had been subdued. The
conquerors, who made themselves paramount over the other tribes and
who developed the Kami religion, abolished this relic of savagery,
and gave order where there had been chronic war. Another thing that
impresses us because of its abundant illustrations, is the
prevalence of human sacrifices. The very ancient folk-lore shows
that beautiful maidens were demanded by the "sea-gods" in
propitiation, or were devoured by the "dragons." These human
victims were either chosen or voluntarily offered, and in some
instances were rescued from their fate by chivalrous heroes<a id=
"footnotetag3-23" name="footnotetag3-23"></a><a href=
"#footnote3-23"><sup>23</sup></a> from among the invaders.</p>
<p>These gods of the sea, who anciently were propitiated by the
sacrifice of human beings, are the same to whom Japanese sailors
still pray, despite their Buddhism. The title of the efficient
victims was <i>hitoga-shira</i>, or human pillars. Instances of
this ceremony, where men were lowered into the water and drowned in
order to make the sure foundation for bridges, piers or sea-walls,
or where they were buried alive in the earth in order to lay the
right bases for walls or castles, are quite numerous, and most of
the local histories contain specific traditions.<a id=
"footnotetag3-24" name="footnotetag3-24"></a><a href=
"#footnote3-24"><sup>24</sup></a> These traditions, now
transfigured, still survive in customs that are as beautiful as
they are harmless. To reformers of pre-Buddhistic days, belongs the
credit of the abolition of jun-shi, or dying with the master by
burial alive, as well as of the sacrifice to dragons and
sea-gods.</p>
<p>Strange as it may seem, before Buddhism captured <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>{76}</span> and made use
of Shint[=o] for its own purposes (just as it stands ready to-day
to absorb Christianity by making Jesus one of the Palestinian
avatars of the Buddha), the house or tribe of Yamato, with its
claim to descent from the heavenly gods, and with its Mikado or
god-ruler, had given to the Buddhists a precedent and potent
example. Shint[=o], as a state religion or union of politics and
piety, with its system of shrines and festivals, and in short the
whole Kami no Michi, or Shint[=o] as we know it, from the sixth to
the eighth century, was in itself (in part at least), a case of the
absorption of one religion by another.</p>
<p>In short, the Mikado tribe or Yamato clan did, in reality,
capture the aboriginal religion, and turn it into a great political
machine. They attempted syncretism and succeeded in their scheme.
They added to their own stock of dogma and fetich that of the
natives. Only, while recognizing the (earth) gods of the aborigines
they proclaimed the superiority of the Mikado as representative and
vicegerent of Heaven, and demanded that even the gods of the earth,
mountain, river, wind, and thunder and lightning should obey him.
Not content, however, with absorbing and corrupting for political
purposes the primitive faith of the aborigines, the invaders
corrupted their own religion by carrying the dogma of the divinity
and infallibility of the Mikado too far. Stopping short of no
absurdity, they declared their chief greater even than the heavenly
gods, and made their religion centre in him rather than in his
alleged heavenly ancestors, or "heaven." In the interest of
politics and conquest, and for the sake of maintaining the prestige
of their tribe and clan, these "Mikado-reverencers" of early ages
advanced <span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id=
"page77"></a>{77}</span> from dogma to dogma, until their leader
was virtually chief god in a great pantheon.</p>
<p>A critical native Japanese, student of the Kojiki and of the
early writings, Professor Kumi, formerly of the Imperial University
in T[=o]ki[=o], has brought to light abundant evidence to show that
the aboriginal religion found by the Yamato conquerors was markedly
different at many vital points, from that which was long afterward
called Shint[=o].</p>
<p>If the view of recent students of anthropology be correct, that
the elements dominating the population in ancient Japan were in the
south, Malay; in the north, Aino; and in the central region, or
that occupied by the Yamato men, Korean; then, these continental
invaders may have been worshippers of Heaven and have possessed a
religion closely akin to that of ancient China with its monotheism.
It is very probable also that they came into contact with tribes or
colonies of their fellow-continentals from Asia. These tribes,
hunters, fishermen, or rude agriculturists&mdash;who had previously
reached Japan&mdash;practised many rites and ceremonies which were
much like those of the new invaders. It is certain also, as we have
seen, that the Yamato men made ultimate conquest and unification of
all the islanders, not merely by the superiority of their valor and
of their weapons of iron, but also by their dogmas. After success
in battle, and the first beginnings of rude government, they taught
their conquered subjects or over-awed vassals, that they were the
descendants of the heavenly gods; that their ancestors had come
down from heaven; find that their chief or Mikado was a god.
According to the same dogmatics, the aborigines were descendants of
the earth-born <span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id=
"page78"></a>{78}</span> gods, and as such must obey the
descendants of the heavenly gods, and their vicegerent upon the
earth, the Mikado.</p>
<h3>Purification of Offences.</h3>
<p>These heaven-descended Yamato people were in the main
agriculturists, though of a rude order, while the outlying tribes
were mostly hunters and fishermen; and many of the rituals show the
class of crimes which nomads, or men of unsettled life, would
naturally commit against their neighbors living in comparatively
settled order. It is to be noted that in the god-way the origin of
evil is to be ascribed to evil gods. These kami pollute, and
pollution is iniquity. From this iniquity the people are to be
purged by the gods of purification, to whom offerings are duly
made.</p>
<p>He who would understand the passion for cleanliness which
characterizes the Japanese must look for its source in their
ancient religion. The root idea of the word <i>tsumi</i>, which Mr.
Satow translated as "offence," is that of pollution. On this basis,
of things pure and things defiling, the ancient teachers of
Shint[=o] made their classification of what was good and what was
bad. From the impression of what was repulsive arose the idea of
guilt.</p>
<p>In rituals translated by Mr. Satow, the list of offences is
given and the defilements are to be removed to the nether world,
or, in common fact, the polluted objects and the expiatory
sacrifices are to be thrown into the rivers and thence carried to
the sea, where they fall to the bottom of the earth. The following
norito clearly shows this. Furthermore, as Mr. Satow, the
translator, points out, this ritual contains the germ of criminal
law, a whole code of which might have been <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>{79}</span> evolved and
formulated under Shint[=o], had not Buddhism arrested its
growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amongst the various sorts of offences which may be committed in
ignorance or out of negligence by heaven's increasing people, who
shall come into being in the country, which the Sovran GRANDCHILD'S
augustness, hiding in the fresh RESIDENCE, built by stoutly
planting the HOUSE-pillars on the bottom-most rocks, and exalting
the cross-beams to the plain of high heaven, as his SHADE from the
heavens and SHADE from the sun, shall tranquilly ruin as a peaceful
country, namely, the country of great Yamato, where the sun is soon
on high, which he fixed upon as a peaceful country, as the centre
of the countries of the four quarters thus bestowed upon
him&mdash;breaking the ridges, filling up water-courses, opening
sluices, double-sowing, planting stakes, flaying alive, flaying
backwards, and dunging; many of such offences are distinguished as
heavenly offences, and as earthly offences; cutting living flesh,
cutting dead flesh, leprosy, proud-flesh, ... calamities of
crawling worms, calamities of a god on high, calamities of birds on
high, the offences of killing beasts and using incantations; many
of such offences may be disclosed.</p>
<p>When he has thus repeated it, the heavenly gods will push open
heaven's eternal gates, and cleaving a path with might through the
manifold clouds of heaven, will hear; and the country gods,
ascending to the tops of the high mountains, and to the tops of the
low hills, and tearing asunder the mists of the high mountains and
the mists of the low hills, will hear.</p>
<p>And when they have thus heard, the
Maiden-of-Descent-into-the-Current, who dwells in the current of
the swift stream which boils down the ravines from the tops of the
high mountains, and the tops of the low hills, shall carry out to
the great sea plain the offences which are cleared away and
purified, so that there be no remaining offence; like as Shinato's
wind blows apart the manifold clouds of heaven, as the morning wind
and the evening wind blow away the morning mist and the evening
mist, as the great ships which lie on the shore of a great port
loosen their prows, and loosen their sterns to push <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>{80}</span> out into the
great sea-plain; as the trunks of the forest trees, far and near,
are cleared away by the sharp sickle, the sickle forged with fire:
so that there ceased to be any offence called an offence in the
court of the Sovran GRANDCHILD'S augustness to begin with, and in
the countries of the four quarters of the region under heaven.</p>
<p>And when she thus carries them out and away, the deity called
the Maiden-of-the-Swift-cleansing, who dwells in the multitudinous
meetings of the sea waters, the multitudinous currents of rough
sea-waters shall gulp them down.</p>
<p>And when she has thus gulped them down, the lord of the
Breath-blowing-place, who dwells in the Breath-blowing-place, shall
utterly blow them away with his breath to the Root-country, the
Bottom-country.</p>
<p>And when he has thus blown them away, the deity called the
Maiden-of-Swift-Banishment, who dwells in the Root-country, the
Bottom-country, shall completely banish them, and get rid of
them.</p>
<p>And when they have thus been got rid of, there shall from this
day onwards be no offence which is called offence, with regard to
the men of the offices who serve in the court of the Sovran, nor in
the four quarters of the region under heaven.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the high priest says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hear all of you how he leads forth the horse, as a thing that
erects its ears towards the plain of high heaven, and deigns to
sweep away and purify with the general purification, as the evening
sun goes down on the last day of the watery moon of this year.</p>
<p>O diviners of the four countries, take (the sacrifices) away out
to the river highway, and sweep them away.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Mikadoism Usurps the Primitive God-way.</h3>
<p>A further proof of the transformation of the primitive god-way
in the interest of practical politics, is shown by Professor Kumi
in the fact that some of the festivals now <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>{81}</span> directly
connected with the Mikado's house, and even in his honor, were
originally festivals with which he had nothing to do, except as
leader of the worship, for the honor was paid to Heaven, and not to
his ancestors. Professor Kumi maintains that the thanksgivings of
the court were originally to Heaven itself, and not in honor of
Amat&eacute;ras[)u], the sun-goddess, as is now popularly believed.
It is related in the Kojiki that Amat&eacute;ras[)u] herself
celebrated the feast of Niinam&eacute;. So also, the temple of
Is&eacute;, the Mecca of Shint[=o], and the Holy shrine in the
imperial palace were originally temples for the worship of Heaven.
The inferior gods of earthly origin form no part of primitive
Shint[=o].</p>
<p>Not one of the first Mikados was deified after death, the
deification of emperors dating from the corruption which Shint[=o]
underwent after the introduction of Buddhism. Only by degrees was
the ruler of the country given a place in the worship, and this
connection was made by attributing to him descent from Heaven. In a
word, the contention of Professor Kumi is, that the ancient
religion of at least a portion of the Japanese and especially of
those in central Japan, was a rude sort of monotheism, coupled, as
in ancient China, with the worship of subordinate spirits.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that such applications of the higher
criticism to the ancient sacred documents proved to be no safer for
the applier than if he had lived in the United States of America.
The orthodox Shint[=o]ists were roused to wrath and charged the
learned critic with "degrading Shint[=o] to a mere branch of
Christianity." The government, which, despite its Constitution and
Diet, is in the eyes of the people <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page82" id="page82"></a>{82}</span> really based on the myths of
the Kojiki, quickly put the professor on the retired list.<a id=
"footnotetag3-25" name="footnotetag3-25"></a><a href=
"#footnote3-25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>It is probably correct to say that the arguments adduced by
Professor Kumi, confirm our theory of the substitution in the
simple god-way, of Mikadoism, the centre of the primitive worship
being the sun and nature rather than Heaven.</p>
<p>Between the ancient Chinese religion with its abstract idea of
Heaven and its personal term for God, and the more poetic and
childlike system of the god-way, there seems to be as much
difference as there is racially between the people of the Middle
Kingdom and those of the Land Where the Day Begins. Indeed, the
entrance of Chinese philosophical and abstract ideas seemed to
paralyze the Japanese imagination. Not only did myth-making, on its
purely &aelig;sthetic and non-utilitarian side cease almost at
once, but such myths as were formed were for direct business
purposes and with a transparent tendency. Henceforth, in the domain
of imagination the Japanese intellect busied itself with
assimilating or re-working the abundant material imported by
Buddhism.</p>
<h3>Ancient Customs and Usages.</h3>
<p>In the ancient god-way the temple or shrine was called a miya.
After the advent of Buddhism the keepers of the shrine were called
kannushi, that is, shrine keepers or wardens of the god. These men
were usually descendants of the god in whose honor the temples were
built. The gods being nothing more than human founders of families,
reverence was paid to them as ancestors, and so the basis of
Shint[=o] is ancestor <span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id=
"page83"></a>{83}</span> worship. The model of the miya, in modern
as in ancient times, is the primitive hut as it was before Buddhism
introduced Indian and Chinese architecture. The posts, stuck in the
ground, and not laid upon stones as in after times, supported the
walls and roof, the latter being of thatch. The rafters, crossed at
the top, were tied along the ridge-pole with the fibres of creepers
or wistaria vines. No paint, lacquer, gilding, or ornaments of any
sort existed in the ancient shrine, and even to-day the modern
Shint[=o] temple must be of pure hinoki or sun-wood, and thatched,
while the use of metal is as far as possible avoided. To the gods,
as the norito show, offerings of various kinds were made,
consisting of the fruits of the soil, the products of the sea, and
the fabrics of the loom.</p>
<p>Inside modern temples one often sees a mirror, in which
foreigners with lively imaginations read a great deal that is only
the shadow of their own mind, but which probably was never known in
Shint[=o] temples until after Buddhist times. They also see in
front of the unpainted wooden closets or casements, wands or sticks
of wood from which depend masses or strips of white paper, cut and
notched in a particular way. Foreigners, whose fancy is nimble,
have read in these the symbols of lightning, the abode of the
spirits and various forthshadowings unknown either to the Japanese
or the ancient writings. In reality these <i>gohei</i>, or
honorable offerings, are nothing more than the paper
representatives of the ancient offerings of cloth which were woven,
as the arts progressed, of bark, of hemp and of silk.</p>
<p>The chief Shint[=o] ministers of religion and shrine-keepers
belonged to particular families, which were often <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>{84}</span> honored with
titles and offices by the emperor. In ordinary life they dressed
like others of their own rank or station, but when engaged in their
sacred office were robed in white or in a special official costume,
wearing upon their heads the <i>&eacute;boshi</i> or peculiar cap
which we associate with Japanese arch&aelig;ology. They knew
nothing of celibacy; but married, reared families and kept their
scalps free from the razor, though some of the lower order of
shrine-keepers dressed their hair in ordinary style, that is, with
shaven poll and topknot. At some of the more important shrines,
like those at Is&eacute;, there were virgin priestesses who acted
as custodians both of the shrines and of the relics.<a id=
"footnotetag3-26" name="footnotetag3-26"></a><a href=
"#footnote3-26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>In front of the miyas stood what we should suppose on first
seeing was a gateway. This was the <i>torii</i> or bird-perch, and
anciently was made only of unpainted wood. Two upright tree-trunks
held crosswise on a smooth tree-trunk the ends of which projected
somewhat over the supports, while under this was a smaller beam
inserted between the two uprights. On the torii, the birds,
generally barn-yard fowls which were sacred to the gods, roosted.
These creatures were not offered up as sacrifices, but were
chanticleers to give notice of day-break and the rising of the sun.
The cock holds a prominent place in Japanese myth, legend, art and
symbolism. How this feature of pure Japanese architecture, the
torii, afterward lost its meaning, we shall show in our lecture on
Riy[=o]bu or mixed Buddhism.</p>
<h3>Shint[=o]'s Emphasis on Cleanliness.</h3>
<p>One of the most remarkable features of Shint[=o] was the
emphasis laid on cleanliness. Pollution was calamity, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>{85}</span> defilement
was sin, and physical purity at least, was holiness. Everything
that could in any way soil the body or the clothing was looked upon
with abhorrence and detestation. Disease, wounds and death were
defiling, and the feeling of disgust prevailed over that of either
sympathy or pity. Birth and death were especially polluting.
Anciently there were huts built both for the mother about to give
birth to a child, or for the man who was dying or sure to die of
disease or wounds. After the birth of the infant or the death of
the patient these houses were burned. Cruel as this system was to
the woman at a time when she needed most care and comfort, and
brutal as it seems in regard to the sick and dying, yet this
ancient custom was continued in a few remote places in Japan as
late as the year 1878.<a id="footnotetag3-27" name=
"footnotetag3-27"></a><a href="#footnote3-27"><sup>27</sup></a> In
modern days with equal knowledge of danger and defilement,
tenderness and compassion temper the feeling of disgust, and
prevail over it. Horror of uncleanliness was so great that the
priests bathed and put on clean garments before making the sacred
offerings or chanting the liturgies, and were accustomed to bind a
slip of paper over their mouths lest their breath should pollute
the offering. Numerous were the special festivals, observed simply
for purification. Salt also was commonly used to sprinkle over the
ground, and those who attended a funeral must free themselves from
contamination by the use of salt.<a id="footnotetag3-28" name=
"footnotetag3-28"></a><a href="#footnote3-28"><sup>28</sup></a>
Purification by water was habitual and in varied forms. The ancient
emperors and priests actually performed the ablution of the people
or made public lustration in their behalf.</p>
<p>Afterwards, and probably because population increased and towns
sprang up, we find it was customary <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page86" id="page86"></a>{86}</span> at the festivals of
purification to perform public ablution, vicariously, as it were,
by means of paper mannikins instead of making applications of water
to the human cuticle. Twice a year paper figures representing the
people were thrown into the river, the typical meaning of which was
that the nation was thereby cleansed from the sins, that is, the
defilements, of the previous half-year. Still later, the Mikado
made the chief minister of religion at Ki[=o]to his deputy to
perform the symbolical act for the people of the whole country.</p>
<h3>Prayers to Myriads of Gods.</h3>
<p>In prayer, the worshipper, approaching the temple but not
entering it, pulls a rope usually made of white material and
attached to a peculiar-shaped bell hung over the shrine, calling
the attention of the deity to his devotions. Having washed his
hands and rinsed out his mouth, he places his hands reverently
together and offers his petition.</p>
<p>Concerning the method and words of prayer, Hirata, a famous
exponent of Shint[=o], thus writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the number of the gods who possess different functions is so
great, it will be convenient to worship by name only the most
important and to include the rest in a general petition. Those
whose daily affairs are so multitudinous that they have not time to
go through the whole of the following morning prayers, may content
themselves with adoring the residence of the emperor, the domestic
kami-dana, the spirits of their ancestors, their local patron god
and the deity of their particular calling in life.</p>
<p>In praying to the gods the blessings which each has it in his
power to bestow are to be mentioned in a few words, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>{87}</span>
are not to be annoyed with greedy petitions, for the Mikado in his
palace offers up petitions daily on behalf of his people, which are
far more effectual than those of his subjects.</p>
<p>Rising early in the morning, wash your face and hands, rinse out
the mouth and cleanse the body. Then turn toward the province of
Yamato, strike the palms of the hands together twice, and worship,
bowing the head to the ground. The proper posture is that of
kneeling on the heels, which is ordinarily assumed in saluting a
superior.</p>
<p>PRAYER.</p>
<p>From a distance I reverently worship with awe before Am&eacute;
no Mi-hashira (Heaven-pillar) and Kuni no Mi-hashira
(Country-pillar), also called Shinatsu-hiko no kami and
Shinatsu-him&eacute; no kami, to whom is consecrated the Palace
built with stout pillars at Tatsuta no Tachinu in the department of
H&eacute;guri in the province of Yamato.</p>
<p>I say with awe, deign to bless me by correcting the unwitting
faults which, seen and heard by you, I have committed, by blowing
off and clearing away the calamities which evil gods might inflict,
by causing me to live long like the hard and lasting rock, and by
repeating to the gods of heavenly origin and to the gods of earthly
origin the petitions which I present every day, along with your
breath, that they may hear with the sharp-earedness of the
forth-galloping colt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the common people the sun is actually a god, as none can
doubt who sees them worshipping it morning and evening. The writer
can never forget one of many similar scenes in T[=o]ki[=o], when
late one afternoon after O Tent[=o] Sama (the sun-Lord of Heaven),
which had been hidden behind clouds for a fortnight, shone out on
the muddy streets. In a moment, as with the promptness of a
military drill, scores of people rushed out of their houses and
with faces westward, kneeling, squatting, began prayer and worship
before the great luminary. Besides all the gods, supreme,
subordinate <span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id=
"page88"></a>{88}</span> and local, there is in nearly every house
the Kami-dana or god-shelf. This is usually over the door inside.
It contains images with little paper-covered wooden tablets having
the god's name on them. Offerings are made by day and a little lamp
is lighted at night. The following is one of several prayers which
are addressed to this kami-dana.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reverently adoring the great god of the two palaces of
Is&eacute;, in the first place, the eight hundred myriads of
celestial gods, the eight hundred myriads of terrestrial gods, all
the fifteen hundred myriads of gods to whom are consecrated the
great and small temples in all provinces, all islands and all
places of the Great Land of Eight Islands, the fifteen hundreds of
myriads of gods whom they cause to serve them, and the gods of
branch palaces and branch temples, and Sohodo no kami, whom I have
invited to the shrine set up on this divine shelf, and to whom I
offer praises day by day, I pray with awe that they will deign to
correct the unwitting faults, which, heard and seen by them, I have
committed, and blessing and favoring me according to the powers
which they severally wield, cause me to follow the divine example,
and to perform good works in the Way.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Shint[=o] Left in a State of Arrested Development.</h3>
<p>Thus from the emperor to the humblest believer, the god-way is
founded on ancestor worship, and has had grafted upon its ritual
system nature worship, even to phallicism.<a id="footnotetag3-29"
name="footnotetag3-29"></a><a href=
"#footnote3-29"><sup>29</sup></a> In one sense it is a self-made
religion of the Japanese. Its leading characteristics are seen in
the traits of the normal Japanese character of to-day. Its power
for good and evil may be traced in the education of the Japanese
through many centuries. Knowing Shint[=o], we to a large degree
know the Japanese, their virtues and their failings.</p>
<p>What Shint[=o] might have become in its full evolution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>{89}</span>
had it been left alone, we cannot tell. Whether in the growth of
the nation and without the pressure of Buddhism, Confucianism or
other powerful influences from outside, the scattered and
fragmentary mythology might have become organized into a harmonious
system, or codes of ethics have been formulated, or the doctrines
of a future life and the idea of a Supreme Being with personal
attributes have been conceived and perfected, are questions the
discussion of which may seem to be vain. History, however, gives no
uncertain answer as to what actually did take place. We do but
state what is unchallenged fact, when we say, that after commitment
to writing of the myths, poems and liturgies which may be called
the basis of Shint[=o], there came a great flood of Chinese and
Buddhistic literature and a tremendous expansion of Buddhist
missionary activity, which checked further literary growth of the
kami system. These prepared the way for the absorption of the
indigenous into the foreign cultus under the form called by an
enthusiastic emperor, Riy[=o]bu Shint[=o], or the "two-fold divine
doctrine." Of this, we shall speak in another lecture.</p>
<p>Suffice it here to say that by the scheme of syncretism
propounded by K[=o]b[=o] in the ninth century, Shint[=o] was
practically overlaid by the new faith from India, and largely
forgotten as a distinct religion by the Japanese people. As late as
A.D. 927, there were three thousand one hundred and thirty-two
enumerated metropolitan and provincial temples, besides many more
unenumerated village and hamlet shrines of Shint[=o]. These are
referred to in the revised codes of ceremonial law set forth by
imperial authority early in the tenth century. Probably by the
twelfth century the pure rites <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page90" id="page90"></a>{90}</span> of the god-way were
celebrated, and the unmixed traditions maintained, in families and
temples, so few as to be counted on the fingers. The ancient
language in which the archaic forms had been preserved was so
nearly lost and buried, that out of the ooze of centuries of
oblivion, it had to be rescued by the skilled divers of the
seventeenth century. Mabuchi, Mot&ouml;ri and the other revivalists
of pure Shint[=o], like the plungers after orient pearls,
persevered until they had first recovered much that had been
supposed irretrievably lost. These scholars deciphered and
interpreted the ancient scriptures, poetry, prose, history, law and
ritual, and once more set forth the ancient faith, as they
believed, in its purity.</p>
<p>Whether, however, men can exactly reproduce and think for
themselves the thoughts of others who have been dead for a
millennium, is an open question. The new system is apt to be
transparent. Just as it is nearly impossible for us to restore the
religious life, thoughts and orthodoxy of the men who lived before
the flood, so in the writings of the revivalists of pure Shint[=o]
we detect the thoughts of Dutchmen, of Chinese, and of very modern
Japanese. Unconsciously, those who would breathe into the dry bones
of dead Shint[=o] the breath of the nineteenth century, find
themselves compelled to use an oxygen and nitrogen generator made
in Holland and mounted with Chinese apparatus; withal, lacquered
and decorated with the art of to-day. To change from metaphor to
matter of fact, modern "pure Shint[=o]" is mainly a mass of
speculation and philosophy, with a tendency of which the ancient
god-way knew nothing.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>{91}</span>
<h3>The Modern Revivalists of Kami no Michi.</h3>
<p>Passing by further mention of the fifteen or more corrupt sects
of Shint[=o]ists, we name with honor the native scholars of the
seventeenth century, who followed the illustrious example of
Iy&eacute;yas[)u], the political unifier of Japan. They ransacked
the country and purchased from temples, mansions and farmhouses,
old manuscripts and books, and forming libraries began anew the
study of ancient language and history. K&eacute;ichu (1640-1701), a
Buddhist priest, explored and illumined the poems of the
Many[=o]shu. Kada Adzumar[=o], born in 1669 near Ki[=o]to, the son
of a shrine-keeper at Inari, attempted the mastery of the whole
archaic native language and literature. He made a grand beginning.
He is unquestionably the founder of the school of Pure Shint[=o].
He died in 1736. His successor and pupil was Mabuchi (1697-1769),
who claimed direct descent from that god which in the form of a
colossal crow had guided the first chief of the Yamato tribe as he
led his invaders through the country to found the line of Mikados.
After Mabuchi came Moto&ouml;ri (1730-1801) a remarkable scholar
and critic, who, with erudition and acuteness, analyzed the ancient
literature and showed what were Chinese or imported elements and
what was of native origin. He summarized the principles of the
ancient religion, reasserted and illuminated with amazing learning
and voluminous commentary the archaic documents, expounded and
defended the ancient cosmogony, and in the usual style of Japanese
polemics preached anew the doctrines of Shint[=o]. With wonderful
na&iuml;vet&eacute; and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id=
"page92"></a>{92}</span> enthusiasm, Moto&ouml;ri taught that Japan
was the first part of the earth created, and that it is therefore
The Land of the Gods, the Country of the Holy Spirits. The stars
were created from the muck which fell from the spear of Izanagi as
he thrust it into the warm earth, while the other countries were
formed by the spontaneous consolidation of the foam of the sea.
Morals were invented by the Chinese because they were an immoral
people, but in Japan there is no necessity for any system of
morals, as every Japanese acts aright if he only consults his own
heart. The duty of a good Japanese consists in obeying the Mikado,
without questioning whether his commands are right or wrong. The
Mikado is god and vicar of all the gods, hence government and
religion are the same, the Mikado being the centre of Church and
State, which are one. Did the foreign nations know their duty they
would at once hasten to pay tribute to the Son of Heaven in
Ki[=o]to.</p>
<p>It is needless here to dwell upon the tremendous power of
Shint[=o] as a political system, especially when wedded with the
forces, generated in the minds of the educated Japanese by modern
Confucianism. The Chinese ethical system, expanded into a
philosophy as fascinating as the English materialistic school of
to-day, entered Japan contemporaneously with the revival of the Way
of the Gods and of native learning. In full rampancy of their
vigor, in the seventeenth century these two systems began that
generation of national energy, which in the eighteenth century was
consolidated and which in the nineteenth century, though unknown
and unsuspected by Europeans or Americans, was all ready for
phenomenal manifestation <span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id=
"page93"></a>{93}</span> and tremendous eruption, even while
Perry's fleet was bearing the olive branch to Japan. As we all
know, this consolidation of forces from the inside, on meeting, not
with collision but with union, the exterior forces of western
civilization, formed a resultant in the energies which have made
New Japan.</p>
<h3>The Great Purification of 1870.</h3>
<p>In 1870, with the Sh[=o]gun of Yedo deposed, the dual system
abolished, feudalism in its last gasp and Shint[=o] in full
political power, with the ancient council of the gods (Jin Gi Kuan)
once more established, and purified Shint[=o] again the religion of
state, thousands of Riy[=o]bu Shint[=o] temples were at once purged
of all their Buddhist ornaments, furniture, ritual, and everything
that might remind the Japanese of foreign elements. Then began,
logically and actually, the persecution of those Christians, who
through all the centuries of repression and prohibition had
continued their existence, and kept their faith however mixed and
clouded. Theoretically, ancient belief was re-established, yet it
was both physically and morally impossible to return wholly to the
baldness and austere simplicity of those early ages, in which art
and literature were unknown. For a while it seemed as though the
miracle would be performed, of turning back the dial of the ages
and of plunging Japan into the fountain of her own youth.
Propaganda was instituted, and the attempts made to convert all the
Japanese to Shint[=o] tenets and practice were for a while more
lively than edifying; but the scheme was on the whole a splendid
failure, and bitter disappointment succeeded <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>{94}</span> the first
exultation of victory. Confronted by modern problems of society and
government, the Mikado's ministers found themselves unable, if
indeed willing, to entomb politics in religion, as in the ancient
ages. For a little while, in 1868, the Jin Gi Kuan, or Council of
the Gods of Heaven and Earth, held equal authority with the Dai
J[=o] Kuan, or Great Council of the Government. Pretty soon the
first step downward was taken, and from a supreme council it was
made one of the ten departments of the government. In less than a
year followed another retrograde movement and the department was
called a board. Finally, in 1877, the board became a bureau. Now,
it is hard to tell what rank the Shint[=o] cultus occupies in the
government, except as a system of guardianship over the imperial
tombs, a mode of official etiquette, and as one of the acknowledged
religions of the country.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as an element in that amalgam of religions which
forms the creed of most Japanese, Shint[=o] is a living force, and
shares with Buddhism the arena against advancing Christianity,
still supplying much of the spring and motive to patriotism.</p>
<p>The Shint[=o] lecturers with unblushing plagiarism rifled the
storehouses of Chinese ethics. They enforced their lessons from the
Confucian classics. Indeed, most of their homiletical and
illustrative material is still derived directly therefrom. Their
three main official theses and commandments were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Thou shalt honor the Gods and love thy country.</p>
<p>2. Thou shalt clearly understand the principles of Heaven, and
the duty of man.</p>
<p>3. Thou shalt revere the Emperor as thy sovereign and obey the
will of his Court.</p>

<p>For nearly twenty years this deliverance of the Japanese
Government, which still finds its strongest support in the national
traditions and the reverence of the people for the throne, sufficed
for the necessities of the case. Then the copious infusion of
foreign ideas, the disintegration of the old framework of society,
and the weakening of the old ties of obedience and loyalty, with
the flood of shallow knowledge and education which gave especially
children and young people just enough of foreign ideas to make them
dangerous, brought about a condition of affairs which alarmed the
conservative and patriotic. Like fungus upon a dead tree strange
growths had appeared, among others that of a class of violently
patriotic and half-educated young men and boys, called
<i>Sosh&iacute;</i>. These hot-headed youths took it upon
themselves to dictate national policy to cabinet ministers, and to
reconstruct society, religion and politics. Something like a mania
broke out all over the country which, in certain respects, reminds
us of the Children's Crusade, that once afflicted Europe and the
children themselves. Even Christianity did not escape the craze for
reconstruction. Some of the young believers and pupils of the
missionaries seemed determined to make Christianity all over so as
to suit themselves. This phase of brain-swelling is not yet wholly
over. One could not tell but that something like the Tai Ping
rebellion, which disturbed and devastated China, might break
out.</p>
<p>These portentous signs on the social horizon called forth, in
1892, from the government an Imperial Rescript, which required that
the emperor's photograph be exhibited in every school, and saluted
by all teachers and scholars whatever their religious tenets and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>{96}</span>
scruples might be. Most Christians as well as Buddhists, saw
nothing in this at which to scruple. A few, however, finding in it
an offence to conscience, resigned their positions. They considered
the mandate an unwarrantable interference with their rights as
conferred by the constitution of 1889, which in theory is the gift
of the emperor to his people.</p>
<p>The radical Shint[=o]ist, to this day, believes that all
political rights which Japanese enjoy or can enjoy are by virtue of
the Mikado's grace and benevolence. It is certain that all
Japanese, whatever may be their religious convictions, consider
that the constitution depends for its safeguards and its validity
largely upon the oath which the Mikado swore at the shrine of his
heavenly ancestors, that he would himself be obedient to it and
preserve its provisions inviolate. For this solemn ceremony a
special norito or liturgy was composed and recited.</p>
<h3>Summary of Shint[=o].</h3>
<p>Of Shint[=o] as a system we have long ago given our opinion. In
its higher forms, "Shint[=o] is simply a cultured and intellectual
atheism; in its lower forms it is blind obedience to governmental
and priestly dictates." "Shint[=o]," says Mr. Ernest Satow, "as
expounded by Moto&ouml;ri is nothing more than an engine for
reducing the people to a condition of mental slavery." Japan being
a country of very striking natural phenomena, the very soil and air
lend themselves to support in the native mind this system of
worship of heroes and of the forces of nature. In spite, however,
of the conservative power of the ancestral influences, the
patriotic incentives and the easy morals of Shint[=o] <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>{97}</span> under which
lying and licentiousness shelter themselves, it is doubtful whether
with the pressure of Buddhism, and the spread of popular education
and Christianity, Shint[=o] can retain its hold upon the Japanese
people. Yet although this is our opinion, it is but fair, and it is
our duty, to judge every religion by its ideals and not by its
failings. The ideal of Shint[=o] is to make people pure and clean
in all their personal and household arrangements; it is to help
them to live simply, honestly and with mutual good will; it is to
make the Japanese love their country, honor their imperial house
and obey their emperor. Narrow and local as this religion is, it
has had grand exemplars in noble lives and winning characters.</p>
<p>So far as Shint[=o] is a religion, Christianity meets it not as
destroyer but fulfiller, for it too believes that cleanliness is
not only next to godliness but a part of it. Jesus as perfect man
and patriot, Captain of our salvation and Prince of peace, would
not destroy the Yamato damashii&mdash;the spirit of unconquerable
Japan&mdash;but rather enlarge, broaden, and deepen it, making it
love for all humanity. Reverence for ancestral virtue and example,
so far from being weakened, is strengthened, and as for devotion to
king and ruler, law and society, Christianity lends nobler motives
and grander sanctions, while showing clearly, not indeed the way of
the eight million or more gods, but the way to God&mdash;the one
living, only and true, even through Him who said "I am the
Way."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV - THE CHINESE ETHICAL SYSTEM IN JAPAN</h2>
<h3>Confucius a Historical Character.</h3>
<p>If the greatness of a teacher is to be determined by the number
of his disciples, or to be measured by the extent and diversity of
his influence, then the foremost place among all the teachers of
mankind must be awarded to The Master Kung (or Confucius, as the
Jesuit scholars of the seventeenth century Latinized the name).
Certainly, he of all truly historic personages is to-day, and for
twenty-three centuries has been, honored by the largest number of
followers.</p>
<p>Of the many systems of religion in the world, but few are based
upon the teachings of one person. The reputed founders of some of
them are not known in history with any certainty, and of
others&mdash;as in the case of Buddhism&mdash;have become almost as
shadows among a great throng of imaginary Buddhas or other beings
which have sprung from the fancies of the brain and become
incorporated into the systems, although the original teachers may
indeed have been historical.</p>
<p>Confucius is a clear and distinct historic person. His
parentage, place of birth, public life, offices, work and teaching,
are well known and properly authenticated. He used the pen freely,
and not only compiled, edited and transmitted the writings of his
predecessors, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id=
"page102"></a>{102}</span> but composed an historical and
interpretative book. He originated nothing, however, but on the
contrary disowned any purpose of introducing new ideas, or of
expressing thoughts of his own not based upon or in perfect harmony
with the teaching of the ancients. He was not an original thinker.
He was a compiler, an editor, a defender and reproclaimer of the
ancient religion, and an exemplar of the wisdom and writings of the
Chinese fathers. He felt that his duty was exactly that which some
Christian theologians of to-day conscientiously feel to be
theirs&mdash;to receive intact a certain "deposit" or "system" and,
adding nothing to it, simply to teach, illuminate, defend, enforce
and strongly maintain it as "the truth." He gloried in absolute
freedom from all novelty, anticipating in this respect a certain
illustrious American who made it a matter for boasting, that his
school had never originated a new idea.<a id="footnotetag4-1" name=
"footnotetag4-1"></a><a href="#footnote4-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
Whether or not the Master Kung did nevertheless, either consciously
or unconsciously, modify the ancient system by abbreviating or
enlarging it, we cannot now inquire.</p>
<p>Confucius wan born into the world in the year 551 B.C., during
that wonderful century of religious revival which saw the birth of
Ezra, Gautama, and Lao Tsze, and in boyhood he displayed an
unusually sedate temperament which made him seem to be what we
would now call an "old-fashioned child." The period during which he
lived was that of feudal China. From the ago of twenty-two, while
holding an office in the state of Lu within the modern province of
Shan-Tung, he gathered around him young men as pupils with whom,
like Socrates, he conversed in question and answer. He made the
teachings of the ancients the subjects of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>{103}</span> his
research, and he was at all times a diligent student of the
primeval records. These sacred books are called King, or Ki[=o] in
Japanese, and are: Shu King, a collection of historic documents;
Shih King, or Book of Odes; Hsiao King, or Classic of Filial Piety,
and Yi King, or Book of Changes.<a id="footnotetag4-2" name=
"footnotetag4-2"></a><a href="#footnote4-2"><sup>2</sup></a> This
division of the old sacred canon, resembles the Christian or
non-Jewish arrangement of the Old Testament scriptures in the four
parts of Law, History, Poetry and Prophesy, though in the Chinese
we have History, Poetry, Ethics and Divination.<a id=
"footnotetag4-3" name="footnotetag4-3"></a><a href=
"#footnote4-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>His own table-talk, conversations, discussions and notes were
compiled by his pupils, and are preserved in the work entitled in
English, "The Confucian Analects," which is one of the four books
constituting the most sacred portion of Chinese philosophy and
instruction. He also wrote a work named "Spring and Autumn, or
Chronicles of his Native State of Lu from 722 B.C., to 481<a id=
"footnotetag4-4" name="footnotetag4-4"></a><a href=
"#footnote4-4"><sup>4</sup></a> B.C." He "changed his world," as
the Buddhists say, in the year 478 B.C., having lived seventy-three
years.</p>
<h3>Primitive Chinese Faith.</h3>
<p>The pre-Confucian or primitive faith was monotheistic, the
forefathers of the Chinese nation having been believers in one
Supreme Spiritual Being. There is an almost universal agreement
among scholars in translating the term "Shang Ti" as God, and in
reading from these classics that the forefathers "in the ceremonies
at the altars of Heaven and earth ... served God." Concurrently
with the worship of one Supreme God there was also a belief in
subordinate spirits and in the idea of revelation or the
communication <span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id=
"page104"></a>{104}</span> of God with men. This restricted worship
of God was accompanied by reverence for ancestors and the honoring
of spirits by prayers and sacrifices, which resulted, however,
neither in deification nor polytheism. But, as the European
medi&aelig;val schoolmen have done with the Bible, so, after the
death of Confucius the Chinese scholastics by metaphysical
reasoning and commentary, created systems of interpretation which
greatly altered the apparent form and contents of his own and of
the ancient texts. Thus, the original monotheism of the
pre-Confucian documents has been completely obscured by the later
webs of sophistry which have been woven about the original
scriptures. The ancient simplicity of doctrine has been lost in the
mountains of commentary which were piled upon the primitive texts.
Throughout the centuries, the Confucian system has been conditioned
and greatly modified by Taoism, Buddhism and the speculations of
the Chinese wise men.</p>
<p>Confucius, however, did not change or seriously modify the
ancient religion except that, as is more than probable, he may have
laid unnecessary emphasis upon social and political duties, and may
not have been sufficiently interested in the honor to be paid to
Shang Ti or God. He practically ignored the God-ward side of man's
duties. His teachings relate chiefly to duties between man and man,
to propriety and etiquette, and to ceremony and usage. He said that
"To give one's self to the duties due to men and while respecting
spiritual beings to keep aloof from them, may be called
wisdom."<a id="footnotetag4-5" name="footnotetag4-5"></a><a href=
"#footnote4-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>We think that Confucius cut the tap-root of all true progress,
and therefore is largely responsible for the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>{105}</span> arrested
development of China. He avoided the personal term, God (Ti), and
instead, made use of the abstract term, Heaven (Tien). His
teaching, which is so often quoted by Japanese gentlemen, was,
"Honor the Gods and keep them far from you." His image stands in
thousands of temples and in every school, in China, but he is only
revered and never deified.</p>
<p>China has for ages suffered from agnosticism; for no normal
Confucianist can love God, though he may learn to reverence him.
The Emperor periodically worships for his people, at the great
marble altar to Heaven in Peking, with vast holocausts, and the
prayers which are offered may possibly amount to this: "Our Father
who art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy name." But there, as it seems to
a Christian, Chinese imperial worship stops. The people at large,
cut off by this restricted worship from direct access to God, have
wandered away into every sort of polytheism and idolatry, while the
religion of the educated Chinese is a medi&aelig;val philosophy
based upon Confucianism, of which we shall speak hereafter.</p>
<p>The Confucian system as a religion, like a giant with a child's
head, is exaggerated on its moral and ceremonial side as compared
with its spiritual development. Some deny that it is a religion at
all, and call it only a code. However, let us examine the Confucian
ethics which formed the basis and norm of all government in the
family and nation, and are summed up in the doctrine of the "Five
Relations." These are: Sovereign and Minister; Father and Son;
Husband and Wife; Elder Brother and Younger Brother; and Friends.
The relation being stated, the correlative duty arises at once. It
may perhaps be truly said <span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"
id="page106"></a>{106}</span> by Christians that Confucius might
have made a religion of his system of ethics, by adding a sixth and
supreme relation&mdash;that between God and man. This he declined
to do, and so left his people without any aspiration toward the
Infinite. By setting before them only a finite goal he sapped the
principles of progress.<a id="footnotetag4-6" name=
"footnotetag4-6"></a><a href="#footnote4-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3>Vicissitudes of Confucianism.</h3>
<p>After the death of Confucius (478 B.C.) the teachings of the
great master were neglected, but still later they were re-enforced
and expounded in the time (372-289 B.C.) of Meng Ko, or Mencius (as
the name has been Latinized) who was likewise a native of the State
of Lu. At one time a Chinese Emperor attempted in vain to destroy
not only the writings of Confucius but also the ancient classics.
Taoism increased as a power in the religion of China, especially
after the fall of its feudal system. The doctrine of ancestral
worship as commended by the sage had in it much of good, both for
kings and nobles. The common people, however, found that Taoism was
more satisfying. About the beginning of the Christian era Buddhism
entered the Middle Kingdom, and, rapidly becoming popular, supplied
needs for which simple Confucianism was not adequate. It may be
said that in the sixth century&mdash;which concerns us
especially&mdash;although Confucianism continued to be highly
esteemed, Buddhism had become supreme in China&mdash;that venerable
State which is the mother of civilization in all Asia cast of the
Ganges, and the Middle Kingdom among pupil nations.</p>
<p>Confucianism overflowed from China into Korea, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>{107}</span> where to
this day it is predominant even over Buddhism. Thence, it was
carried beyond sea to the Japanese Archipelago, where for possibly
fifteen hundred years it has shaped and moulded the character of a
brave and chivalrous people. Let us now turn from China and trace
its influence and modifications in the Land of the Rising Sun.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that in the sixth century of the Christian
Era, Confucianism was by no means the fully developed philosophy
that it is now and has been for five hundred years. In former
times, the system of Confucius had been received in China not only
as a praiseworthy compendium of ceremonial observances, but also as
an inheritance from the ancients, illumined by the discourses of
the great sage and illustrated by his life and example. It was,
however, very far from being what it is at present&mdash;the
religion of the educated men of the nation, and, by excellence, the
religion of Chinese Asia. But in those early centuries it did not
fully satisfy the Chinese mind, which turned to the philosophy of
Taoism and to the teachings of the Buddhist for intellectual food,
for comfort and for inspiration.</p>
<p>The time when Chinese learning entered Japan, by the way of
Korea, has not been precisely ascertained.<a id="footnotetag4-7"
name="footnotetag4-7"></a><a href="#footnote4-7"><sup>7</sup></a>
It is possible that letters<a id="footnotetag4-8" name=
"footnotetag4-8"></a><a href="#footnote4-8"><sup>8</sup></a> and
writings were known in some parts of the country as early as the
fourth century, but it is nearly certain, that, outside the Court
of the Emperor, there was scarcely even a sporadic knowledge of the
literature of China until the Korean missionaries of Buddhism had
obtained a lodgement in the Mikado's capital. Buddhism was the real
purveyor of the foreign learning and became the vehicle by means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id=
"page108"></a>{108}</span> of which Confucianism, or the Chinese
ethical principles, reached the common people of Japan. The first
missionaries in Japan were heartily in sympathy with the Confucian
ethics, from which no effort was made to alienate them. They were
close allies, and for a thousand years wrought as one force in the
national life. They were not estranged until the introduction, in
the seventeenth century, of the metaphysical and scholastic forms
given to the ancient system by the Chinese schoolmen of the Sung
dynasty (A.D. 960-1333).</p>
<h3>Japanese Confucianism and Feudalism Contemporary.</h3>
<p>The intellectual history of the Japanese prior to their recent
contact with Christendom, may be divided into three eras:</p>
<p>1. The period of early insular or purely native thought, from
before the Christian era until the eighth century; by which time,
Shint[=o], or the indigenous system of worship&mdash;its ritual,
poetry and legend having been committed to writing and its life
absorbed in Buddhism&mdash;had been, as a system, relegated from
the nation and the people to a small circle of scholars and
arch&aelig;ologists.</p>
<p>2. The period from 800 A.D. to the beginning of the seventeenth
century; during which time Buddhism furnished to the nation its
religion, philosophy and culture.</p>
<p>3. From about 1630 A.D. until the present time; during which
period the developed Confucian philosophy, as set forth by Chu Hi
in the twelfth century, has been the creed of a majority of the
educated men of Japan.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id=
"page109"></a>{109}</span>
<p>The political history of the Japanese may also be divided into
three eras:</p>
<p>1. The first extends from the dawn of history until the seventh
century. During this period the system of government was that of
rude feudalism. The conquering tribe of Yamato, having gradually
obtained a rather imperfect supremacy over the other tribes in the
middle and southern portions of the country now called the Empire
of Japan, ruled them in the name of the Mikado.</p>
<p>2. The second period begins in the seventh century, when the
Japanese, copying the Chinese model, adopted a system of
centralization. The country was divided into provinces and was
ruled through boards or ministries at the capital, with governors
sent out from Ki[=o]to for stated periods, directly from the
emperor. During this time literature was chiefly the work of the
Buddhist priests and of the women of the imperial court.</p>
<p>While armies in the field brought into subjection the outlying
tribes and certain noble families rose to prominence at the court,
there was being formed that remarkable class of men called the
Samurai, or servants of the Mikado, which for more than ten
centuries has exercised a profound influence upon the development
of Japan.</p>
<p>In China, the pen and the sword have been kept apart; the
civilian and the soldier, the man of letters and the man of arms,
have been distinct and separate. This was also true in old Loo Choo
(now Riu Kiu), that part of Japan most like China. In Japan,
however, the pen and the sword, letters and arms, the civilian and
the soldier, have intermingled. The <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page110" id="page110"></a>{110}</span> unique product of this
union is seen in the Samurai, or servant of the Mikado.
Military-literati, are unknown in China, but in Japan they carried
the sword and the pen in the same girdle.</p>
<p>3. This class of men had become fully formed by the end of the
twelfth century, and then began the new feudal system, which lasted
until the epochal year 1868 A.D.&mdash;a year of several
revolutions, rather than of restoration pure and simple. After
nearly seven hundred years of feudalism, supreme magistracy, with
power vastly increased beyond that possessed in ancient times, was
restored to the emperor. Then also was abolished the duarchy of
Throne and Camp, of Mikado and Sh[=o]gun, and of the two capitals
Ki[=o]to and Yedo, with the fountain of honor and authority in one
and the fountain of power and execution in the other. Thereupon,
Japan once more presented to the world, unity.</p>
<p>Practically, therefore, the period of the prevalence of the
Confucian ethics and their universal acceptance by the people of
Japan nearly coincides with the period of Japanese feudalism or the
dominance of the military classes.</p>
<p>Although the same ideograph, or rather logogram, was used to
designate the Chinese scholar and the Japanese warrior as well, yet
the former was man of the pen only, while the latter was man of the
pen and of two swords. This historical fact, more than any other,
accounts for the striking differences between Chinese and Japanese
Confucianism. Under this state of things the ethical system of the
sage of China suffered a change, as does almost everything that is
imported into Japan and borrowed by the islanders, but <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>{111}</span> whether
for the better or for the worse we shall not inquire too carefully.
The point upon which we now lay emphasis is this: that, although
the Chinese teacher had made filial piety the basis of his system,
the Japanese gradually but surely made loyalty (Kun-Shin), that is,
the allied relations of sovereign and minister, of lord and
retainer, and of master and servant, not only first in order but
the chief of all. They also infused into this term ideas and
associations which are foreign to the Chinese mind. In the place of
filial piety was Kun-shin, that new growth in the garden of
Japanese ethics, out of which arose the white flower of loyalty
that blooms perennial in history.</p>
<h3>In Japan, Loyalty Displaces Filial Piety.</h3>
<p>This slow but sure adaptation of the exotic to its new
environment, took place during the centuries previous to the
seventeenth of the Christian era. The completed product presented a
growth so strikingly different from the original as to compel the
wonder of those Chinese refugee scholars, who, at Mito<a id=
"footnotetag4-9" name="footnotetag4-9"></a><a href=
"#footnote4-9"><sup>9</sup></a> and Yedo, taught the later dogmas
which are orthodox but not historically Confucian.</p>
<p>Herein lies the difference between Chinese and Japanese ethical
philosophy. In old Japan, loyalty was above filial obedience, and
the man who deserted parents, wife and children for the feudal
lord, received unstinted praise. The corner-stone of the Japanese
edifice of personal righteousness and public weal, is loyalty. On
the other hand, filial piety is the basis of Chinese order and the
secret of the amazing national <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page112" id="page112"></a>{112}</span> longevity, which is one of
the moral wonders of the world, and sure proof of the fulfilment of
that promise which was made on Sinai and wrapped up in the fourth
commandment.</p>
<p>This master passion of the typical Samurai of old Japan made him
regard life as infinitely less than nothing, whenever duty demanded
a display of the virtue of loyalty. "The doctrines of Koshi and
Moshi" (Confucius and Mencius) formed, and possibly even yet form,
the gospel and the quintessence of all wordly wisdom to the
Japanese gentleman; they became the basis of his education and the
ideal which inspired his conceptions of duty and honor; but,
crowning all his doctrines and aspirations was his desire to be
loyal. There might abide loyal, marital, filial, fraternal and
various other relations, but the greatest of all these was loyalty.
Hence the Japanese calendar of saints is not filled with reformers,
alms-givers and founders of hospitals or orphanages, but is
over-crowded with canonized suicides and committers of
<i>hara-kiri</i>. Even today, no man more quickly wins the popular
regard during his life or more surely draws homage to his tomb,
securing even apotheosis, than the suicide, though he may have
committed a crime. In this era of Meiji or enlightened peace, most
appalling is the list of assassinations beginning with the murder
in Ki[=o]to of Yokoi H&eacute;ishiro, who was slain for
recommending the toleration of Christianity, down to the last
cabinet minister who has been knifed or dynamited. Yet in every
case the murderers considered themselves consecrated men and
ministers of Heaven's righteous vengeance.<a id="footnotetag4-10"
name="footnotetag4-10"></a><a href=
"#footnote4-10"><sup>10</sup></a> For centuries, and until
constitutional times, the government of Japan was "despotism
tempered by assassination." <span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"
id="page113"></a>{113}</span> The old-fashioned way of moving a
vote of censure upon the king's ministers was to take off their
heads. Now, however, election by ballot has been substituted for
this, and two million swords have become bric-&agrave;-brac.</p>
<p>A thousand years of training in the ethics of
Confucius&mdash;which always admirably lends itself to the
possessors of absolute power, whether emperors, feudal lords,
masters, fathers, or older brothers&mdash;have so tinged and
colored every conception of the Japanese mind, so dominated their
avenues of understanding and shaped their modes of thought, that
to-day, notwithstanding the recent marvellous development of their
language, which within the last two decades has made it almost a
new tongue,<a id="footnotetag4-11" name=
"footnotetag4-11"></a><a href="#footnote4-11"><sup>11</sup></a> it
is impossible with perfect accuracy to translate into English the
ordinary Japanese terms which are congregated under the general
idea of Kun-shin.</p>
<p>Herein may be seen the great benefit of carefully studying the
minds of those whom we seek to convert. The Christian preacher in
Japan who uses our terms "heaven," "home," "mother," "father,"
"family," "wife," "people," "love," "reverence," "virtue,"
"chastity," etc., will find that his hearers may indeed receive
them, but not at all with the same mental images and associations,
nor with the same proportion and depth, that these words command in
western thought and hearing. One must be exceedingly careful, not
only in translating terms which have been used by Confucius in the
Chinese texts, but also in selecting and rendering the current
expressions of the Japanese teachers and philosophers. In order to
understand each other, Orientals and Occidentals need a great deal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id=
"page114"></a>{114}</span> of mutual intellectual drilling, without
which there will be waste of money, of time, of brains and of
life.</p>
<h3>The Five Relations.</h3>
<p>Let us now glance at the fundamentals of the Confucian
ethics&mdash;the Five Relations&mdash;as they were taught in the
comparatively simple system which prevailed before the new
orthodoxy was proclaimed by Sung schoolmen.</p>
<p>First. Although each of the Chinese and Japanese emperors is
supposed to be, and is called, "father of the people," yet it would
be entirely wrong to imagine that the phrase implies any such
relation, as that of William the Silent to the Dutch, or of
Washington to the American nation. In order to see how far the
emperor was removed from the people during a thousand years, one
needs but to look upon a brilliant painting of the Yamato-Tosa
school, in which the Mikado is represented as sitting behind a
cloud of gold or a thick curtain of fine bamboo, with no one before
the matting-throne but his prime ministers or the empress and his
concubines. For centuries, it was supposed that the Mikado did not
touch the ground with his feet. He went abroad in a curtained car;
and he was not only as mysterious and invisible to the public eye
as a dragon, but he was called such. The attributes of that monster
with many powers and functions, were applied to him, with an
amazing wealth of rhetoric and vocabulary. As well might the common
folks to-day presume to pray unto one of the transcendent Buddhas,
between whom and the needy suppliant there may be hosts upon hosts
of interlopers or mediators, as for an <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>{115}</span> ordinary
subject to petition the emperor or even to gaze upon his dragon
countenance. The change in the constitutional Japan of our day is
seen in the fact that the term "Mikado" is now obsolete. This
description of the relation of sovereign and minister (inaccurately
characterised by some writers on Confucianism as that of "King and
subject," a phrase which might almost fit the constitutional
monarchy of to-day) shows the relation, as it did exist for nearly
a thousand years of Japanese history. We find the same imitation of
procedure, even when imperialism became only a shadow in the
government and the great Sh[=o]gun who called himself "Tycoon," the
ruler in Yedo, aping the majesty of Ki[=o]to, became so powerful as
to be also a dragon. Between the Yedo Sh[=o]gun and the people rose
a great staircase of numberless subordinates, and should a subject
attempt to offer a petition in person he must pay for it by
crucifixion.<a id="footnotetag4-12" name=
"footnotetag4-12"></a><a href="#footnote4-12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>As, under the emperor there were court ministers, heads of
departments, governors and functionaries of all kinds before the
people were reached, so, under the Sh[=o]gun in the feudal days,
there were the Daimi[=o]s or great lords and the Shomi[=o]s or
small lords with their retainers in graduated subordination, and
below these were the servants and general humanity. Even after the
status of man was reached, there were gradations and degradations
through fractions down to ciphers and indeed to minus quantities,
for there existed in the Country of Brave Warriors some tens of
thousands of human beings bearing the names of <i>eta</i> (pariah)
and <i>h[=i]-nin</i> (non-human), who were far below the pale of
humanity.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id=
"page116"></a>{116}</span>
<h3>The Paramount Idea of Loyalty.</h3>
<p>The one idea which dominated all of these classes,<a id=
"footnotetag4-13" name="footnotetag4-13"></a><a href=
"#footnote4-13"><sup>13</sup></a>&mdash;in Old Japan there were no
masses but only many classes&mdash;was that of loyalty. As the
Japanese language shows, every faculty of man was subordinated to
this idea. Confucianism even conditioned the development of
Japanese grammar, as it also did that of the Koreans, by
multiplying honorary prefixes and suffixes and building up all
sociable and polite speech on perpendicular lines. Personality was
next to nothing and individuality was in a certain sense unknown.
In European languages, the pronoun shows how clearly the ideas of
personality and of individuality have been developed; but in the
Japanese language there really are no pronouns, in the sense of the
word as used by the Germanic nations, at least, although there are
hundreds of impersonal and topographical substitutes for
them.<a id="footnotetag4-14" name="footnotetag4-14"></a><a href=
"#footnote4-14"><sup>14</sup></a> The mirror, of the language
itself, reflects more truth upon this point of inquiry than do
patriotic assertions, or the protests of those who in the days of
this Meiji era so handsomely employ the Japanese language as the
medium of thought. Strictly speaking, the ego disappears in
ordinary conversation and action, and instead, it is the servant
speaking reverently to his master; or it is the master
condescending to the object which is "before his hand" or "to the
side" or "below" where his inferior kneels; or it is the "honorable
right" addressing the "esteemed left."</p>
<p>All the terms which a foreigner might use in speaking of the
duties of sovereign and minister, of lord and retainer and of
master and servant, are comprehended <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page117" id="page117"></a>{117}</span> in the Japanese word,
Kun-shin, in which is crystallized but one thought, though it may
relate to three grades of society. The testimony of history and of
the language shows, that the feelings which we call loyalty and
reverence are always directed upward, while those which we term
benevolence and love invariably look downward.</p>
<p>Note herein the difference between the teachings of Christ and
those of the Chinese sage. According to the latter, if there be
love in the relation of the master and servant, it is the master
who loves, and not the servant who may only reverence. It would be
inharmonious for the Japanese servant to love his master; he never
even talks of it. And in family life, while the parent may love the
child, the child is not expected to love the parent but rather to
reverence him. So also the Japanese wife, as in our old scriptural
versions, is to "see that she <i>reverence</i> her husband." Love
(not <i>agap&eacute;</i>, but <i>eros</i>) is indeed a theme of the
poets and of that part of life and of literature which is, strictly
speaking, outside of the marriage relation, but the thought that
dominates in marital life, is reverence from the wife and
benevolence from the husband. The Christian conception, which
requires that a woman should love her husband, does not strictly
accord with the Confucian idea.</p>
<p>Christianity has taught us that when a man loves a woman purely
and makes her his wife, he should also have reverence for her, and
that this element should be an integral part of his love.
Christianity also teaches a reverence for children; and Wordsworth
has but followed the spirit of his great master, Christ, when
expressing this beautiful sentiment in his melodious <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>{118}</span> numbers.
Such ideas as these, however, are discords in Japanese social life
of the old order. So also the Christian preaching of love to God,
sounds outlandish to the men of Chinese mind in the middle or the
pupil kingdom, who seem to think that it can only come from the
lips of those who have not been properly trained. To "love God"
appears to them as being an unwarrantable patronage of, and
familiarity with "Heaven," or the King of Kings. The same
difficulty, which to-day troubles Christian preachers and
translators, existed among the Roman Catholic missionaries three
centuries ago.<a id="footnotetag4-15" name=
"footnotetag4-15"></a><a href="#footnote4-15"><sup>15</sup></a> The
moulds of thought were not then, nor are they even now, entirely
ready for the full truth of Christian revelation.</p>
<h3>Suicide Made Honorable.</h3>
<p>In the long story of the Honorable Country, there are to be
found many shining examples of loyalty, which is the one theme
oftenest illustrated in popular fiction and romance. Its
well-attested instances on the crimson thread of Japanese history
are more numerous than the beads on many rosaries. The most famous
of all, perhaps, is the episode of the Forty-Seven R[=o]nins, which
is a constant favorite in the theatres, and has been so graphically
narrated or pictured by scores of native poets, authors, artists,
sculptors and dramatists, and told in English by Mitford, Dickens
and Grecy.<a id="footnotetag4-16" name=
"footnotetag4-16"></a><a href="#footnote4-16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>These forty-seven men hated wife, child, society, name, fame,
food and comfort for the sake of avenging the death of their
master. In a certain sense, they ceased to be persons in order to
become the impersonal <span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id=
"page119"></a>{119}</span> instruments of Heaven's retribution.
They gave up every thing&mdash;houses, lands, kinsmen&mdash;that
they might have in this life the hundred-fold reward of vengeance,
and in the world-life of humanity throughout the centuries, fame
and honor. Feeding the hunger of their hearts upon the hope of
glutting that hunger with the life-blood of their victim, they
waited long years. When once their swords had drunk the consecrated
blood, they laid the severed head upon their master's tomb and then
gladly, even rapturously, delivered themselves up, and ripping open
their bowels they died by that judicially ordered seppuku which
cleansed their memory from every stain, and gave to them the
martyr's fame and crown forever. The tombs of these men, on the
hillside overlooking the Bay of Yedo, are to this day ever fragrant
with fresh flowers, and to the cemetery where their ashes lie and
their memorials stand, thousands of pilgrims annually wend their
way. No dramas are more permanently popular on the stage than those
which display the virtues of these heroes, who are commonly spoken
of as "The righteous Samurai." Their tombs have stood for two
centuries, as mighty magnets drawing others to self-impalement on
the sword&mdash;as multipliers of suicides.</p>
<p>Yet this alphabetic number, this <i>i-ro-ha</i> of self-murder,
is but one of a thousand instances in the Land of Noble Suicides.
From the pre-historic days when the custom of <i>Jun-shi</i>, or
dying with the master, required the interment of the living
retainers with the dead lord, down through all the ages to the
Revolution of 1868, when at Sendai and Aidzu scores of men and boys
opened their bowels, and mothers slew <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>{120}</span> their
infant sons and cut their own throats, there has been flowing
through Japanese history a river of suicides' blood<a id=
"footnotetag4-17" name="footnotetag4-17"></a><a href=
"#footnote4-17"><sup>17</sup></a> having its springs in the
devotion of retainers to masters, and of soldiers to a lost cause
as represented by the feudal superior. Shig&eacute;mori, the son of
the prime minister Kiyomori, who protected the emperor even against
his own father, is a model of that Japanese kun-shin which placed
fidelity to the sovereign above filial obedience; though even yet
Shig&eacute;mori's name is the synonym of both virtues. Kusunoki
Masashig&eacute;,<a id="footnotetag4-18" name=
"footnotetag4-18"></a><a href="#footnote4-18"><sup>18</sup></a> the
white flower of Japanese chivalry, is but one, typical not only of
a thousand but of thousands of thousands of soldiers, who hated
parents, wife, child, friend in order to be disciple to the supreme
loyalty. He sealed his creed by emptying his own veins.
Kiyomori,<a id="footnotetag4-19" name=
"footnotetag4-19"></a><a href="#footnote4-19"><sup>19</sup></a>
like King David of Israel, on his dying bed ordered the
assassination of his personal enemy.</p>
<p>The common Japanese novels read like records of
slaughter-houses. No Moloch or Shiva has won more victims to his
shrine than has this idea of Japanese loyalty which is so beautiful
in theory and so hideous in practice. Despite the military clamps
and frightful despotism of Yedo, which for two hundred and fifty
years gave to the world a delusive idea of profound quiet in the
Country of Peaceful Shores, there was in fact a chronic unrest
which amounted at many times and in many places to anarchy. The
calm of despotism was, indeed, rudely broken by the aliens in the
"black ships" with the "flowery flag"; but, without regarding
influences from the West, the indications of history as now read,
pointed in 1850 toward the bloodiest of Japan's many civil wars.
Could the statistics <span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id=
"page121"></a>{121}</span> of the suicides during this long period
be collected, their publication would excite in Christendom the
utmost incredulity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this qualifying statement should be made. A study
of the origin and development of the national method of
self-destruction shows that suicide by seppuku, or opening of the
abdomen, was first a custom, and then a privilege. It took, among
men of honor, the place of the public executions, the massacres in
battle and siege, decimation of rebels and similar means of killing
at the hands of others, which so often mar the historical records
of western nations. Undoubtedly, therefore, in the minds of most
Japanese, there are many instances of <i>hara-kiri</i> which should
not be classed as suicide, but technically as execution of judicial
sentence. And yet no sentence or process of death known in western
lands had such influence in glorifying the victim, as had seppuku
in Japan.</p>
<h3>The Family Idea.</h3>
<p>The Second Relation is that of father and son, thus preceding
what we should suppose to be the first of human
relations&mdash;husband and wife&mdash;but the arrangement entirely
accords with the Oriental conception that the family, the house, is
more important than the individual. In Old Japan the paramount idea
in marriage, was not that of love or companionship, or of mutual
assistance with children, but was almost wholly that of offspring,
and of maintaining the family line.<a id="footnotetag4-20" name=
"footnotetag4-20"></a><a href="#footnote4-20"><sup>20</sup></a> The
individual might perish but the house must live on.</p>
<p>Very different from the family of Christendom, is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id=
"page122"></a>{122}</span> family in Old Japan, in which we find
elements that would not be recognized where monogamy prevails and
children are born in the home and not in the herd. Instead of
father, mother and children, there are father, wife, concubines,
and various sorts of children who are born of the wife or of the
concubine, or have been adopted into the family. With us, adoption
is the exception, but in Japan it is the invariable rule whenever
either convenience or necessity requires it of the house. Indeed it
is rare to find a set of brothers bearing the same family name.
Adoption and concubinage keep the house unbroken.<a id=
"footnotetag4-21" name="footnotetag4-21"></a><a href=
"#footnote4-21"><sup>21</sup></a> It is the house, the name, which
must continue, although not necessarily by a blood line. The name,
a social trade-mark, lives on for ages. The line of Japanese
emperors, which, in the Constitution of 1889, by adding mythology
to history is said to rule "unbroken from ages eternal," is not one
of fathers and sons, but has been made continuous by concubinage
and adoption. In this view, it is possibly as old as the line of
the popes.</p>
<p>It is very evident that our terms and usages do not have in such
a home the place or meaning which one not familiar with the real
life of Old Japan would suppose. The father is an absolute ruler.
There is in Old Japan hardly any such thing as "parents," for
practically there is only one parent, as the woman counts for
little. The wife is honored if she becomes a mother, but if
childless she is very probably neglected. Our idea of fatherhood
implies that the child has rights and that he should love as well
as be loved. Our customs excite not only the merriment but even the
contempt of the old-school Japanese. The kiss and the embrace, the
linking of the child's arm around its <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>{123}</span> father's
neck, the address on letters "My dear Wife" or "My beloved Mother"
seem to them like caricatures of propriety. On the other hand, it
is undoubtedly true that in reverence toward parents&mdash;or at
least toward one of the parents&mdash;a Japanese child is apt to
excel the one born even in a Christian home.</p>
<p>This so-called filial "piety" becomes in practice, however, a
horrible outrage upon humanity and especially upon womanhood.
During centuries the despotic power of the father enabled him to
put an end to the life of his child, whether boy or girl.</p>
<p>Under this abominable despotism there is no protection for the
daughter, who is bound to sell her body, while youth or beauty last
or perhaps for life, to help pay her father's debts, to support an
aged parent or even to gratify his mere caprice. In hundreds of
Japanese romances the daughter, who for the sake of her parents has
sold herself to shame, is made the theme of the story and an object
of praise. In the minds of the people there may be indeed a feeling
of pity that the girl has been obliged to give up her home life for
the brothel, but no one ever thinks of questioning the right of the
parent to make the sale of the girl's body, any more than he would
allow the daughter to rebel against it. This idea still lingers and
the institution remains,<a id="footnotetag4-22" name=
"footnotetag4-22"></a><a href="#footnote4-22"><sup>22</sup></a>
although the system has received stunning blows from the teaching
of Christian ethics, the preaching of a better gospel and the
improvements in the law of the land.</p>
<h3>The Marital Relation.</h3>
<p>The Third Relation is that of husband and wife. The meaning of
these words, however, is not the same <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>{124}</span> with the
Japanese as with us. In Confucius there is not only male and
female, but also superior and inferior, master and servant.<a id=
"footnotetag4-23" name="footnotetag4-23"></a><a href=
"#footnote4-23"><sup>23</sup></a> Without any love-making or
courtship by those most interested, a marriage between two young
people is arranged by their parents through the medium of what is
called a "go-between." The bride leaves her father's house
forever&mdash;that is, when she is not to be subsequently
divorced&mdash;and entering into that of her husband must be
subordinate not only to him but also to his parents, and must obey
them as her own father and mother. Having all her life under her
father's roof reverenced her superiors, she is expected to bring
reverence to her new domicile, but not love. She must always obey
but never be jealous. She must not be angry, no matter whom her
husband may introduce into his household. She must wait upon him at
his meals and must walk behind him, but not with him. When she dies
her children go to her funeral, but not her husband.</p>
<p>A foreigner, hearing the Japanese translate our word chastity by
the term <i>t&eacute;iso</i> or <i>misao</i>, may imagine that the
latter represents mutual obligation and personal purity for man and
wife alike, but on looking into the dictionary he will find that
<i>t&eacute;iso</i> means "Womanly duties." A circumlocution is
needed to express the idea of a chaste man.</p>
<p>Jealousy is a horrible sin, but is always supposed to be a
womanish fault, and so an exhibition of folly and weakness.
Therefore, to apply such a term to God&mdash;to say "a jealous
God"&mdash;outrages the good sense of a Confucianist,<a id=
"footnotetag4-24" name="footnotetag4-24"></a><a href=
"#footnote4-24"><sup>24</sup></a> almost as much as the statement
that God "cannot lie" did that of the Pundit, who wondered how God
could be Omnipotent if He could not lie.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id=
"page125"></a>{125}</span>
<p>How great the need in Japanese social life of some purifying
principle higher than Confucianism can afford, is shown in the
little book entitled "The Japanese Bride,"<a id="footnotetag4-25"
name="footnotetag4-25"></a><a href=
"#footnote4-25"><sup>25</sup></a> written by a native, and scarcely
less in the storm of native criticism it called forth. Under the
system which has ruled Japan for a millennium and a half, divorce
has been almost entirely in the hands of the husband, and the
document of separation, entitled in common parlance the "three
lines and a half," was invariably written by the man. A woman might
indeed nominally obtain a divorce from her husband, but not
actually; for the severance of the marital tie would be the work of
the house or relatives, rather than the act of the wife, who was
not "a person" in the case. Indeed, in the olden time a woman was
not a person in the eye of the law, but rather a chattel. The case
is somewhat different under the new codes,<a id="footnotetag4-26"
name="footnotetag4-26"></a><a href=
"#footnote4-26"><sup>26</sup></a> but the looseness of the marriage
tie is still a scandal to thinking Japanese. Since the breaking up
of the feudal system and the disarrangement of the old social and
moral standards, the statistics made annually from the official
census show that the ratio of divorce to marriage is very nearly as
one to three.<a id="footnotetag4-27" name=
"footnotetag4-27"></a><a href="#footnote4-27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h3>The Elder and the Younger Brother.</h3>
<p>The Fourth Relation is that of Elder Brother and Younger
Brother. As we have said, foreigners in translating some of the
Chinese and Japanese terms used in the system of Confucius are
often led into errors by supposing that the Christian conception of
family life prevails also in Chinese Asia. By many writers this
relation is translated "brother to brother;" <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>{126}</span> but
really in the Japanese language there is no term meaning simply
"brother" or "sister,"<a id="footnotetag4-28" name=
"footnotetag4-28"></a><a href="#footnote4-28"><sup>28</sup></a> and
a circumlocution is necessary to express the ideas which we convey
by these words. It is always "older brother" or "younger brother,"
and "older sister" or "younger sister"&mdash;the male or female
"<i>kiyodai</i>" as the case may be. With us&mdash;excepting in
lands where the law of primogeniture still prevails&mdash;all the
brothers are practically equal, and it would be considered a
violation of Christian righteousness for a parent to show more
favor to one child than to another. In this respect the "wisdom
that cometh from above" is "without partiality." The Chinese
ethical system, however, disregards the principle of mutual rights
and duties, and builds up the family on the theory of the
subordination of the younger brother to the elder brother, the
predominant idea being not mutual love, but, far more than in the
Christian household, that of rank and order. The attitude of the
heir of the family toward the other children is one of
condescension, and they, as well as the widowed mother, regard the
oldest son with reverence. It is as though the commandment given on
Sinai should read, "Honor thy father and thy elder brother."</p>
<p>The mother is an instrument rather than a person in the life of
the house, and the older brother is the one on whom rests the
responsibility of continuing the family line. The younger brothers
serve as subjects for adoption into other families, especially
those where there are daughters to be married and family names to
be continued. In a word, the name belongs to the house and not to
the individual. The habit of naming children after relatives or
friends of the parents, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id=
"page127"></a>{127}</span> or illustrious men and women, is unknown
in Old Japan, though an approach to this common custom among us is
made by conferring or making use of part of a name, usually by the
transferrence of one ideograph forming the name-word. Such a
practice lays stress upon personality, and so has no place in the
country without pronouns, where the idea of continuing the personal
house or semi-personal family, is predominant. The customs
prevalent in life are strong even in death, and the elder brother
or sister, in some provinces, did not go to the funeral of the
younger. This state of affairs is reflected in Japanese literature,
and produces in romance as well as in history many situations and
episodes which seem almost incredible to the Western mind.</p>
<p>In the lands ruled by Confucius the grown-up children usually
live under the parental roof, and there are few independent homes
as we understand them. The so-called family is composed both of the
living and of the dead, and constitutes the unit of society.</p>
<h3>Friendship and Humanity.</h3>
<p>The Fifth Relation&mdash;Friends. Here, again, a mistake is
often made by those who import ideas of Christendom into the terms
used in Chinese Asia, and who strive to make exact equivalent in
exchanging the coins of speech. Occidental writers are prone to
translate the term for the fifth relation into the English phrase
"man to man," which leads the Western reader to suppose that
Confucius taught that universal love for man, as man, which was
instilled and exemplified by Jesus Christ. In translating Confucius
they often <span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id=
"page128"></a>{128}</span> make the same mistake that some have
done who read in Terence's "Self-Tormentor" the line, "I am a man,
and nothing human is foreign to me,"<a id="footnotetag4-29" name=
"footnotetag4-29"></a><a href="#footnote4-29"><sup>29</sup></a> and
imagine that this is the sentiment of an enlightened Christian,
although the context shows that it is only the boast of a busybody
and parasite. What Confucius taught under the fifth relation is not
universality, and, as compared to the teachings of Jesus, is
moonlight, not sunlight. The doctrine of the sage is clearly
expressed in the Analects, and amounts only to courtesy and
propriety. He taught, indeed, that the stranger is to be treated as
a friend; and although in both Chinese and Japanese history there
are illustrious proofs that Confucius had interpreters nobler than
himself, yet it is probable that the doctrine of the stranger's
receiving treatment as a friend, does not extend to the foreigner.
Confucius framed something like the Golden Rule&mdash;though it
were better called a Silver Rule, or possibly a Gilded Rule, since
it is in the negative instead of being definitely placed in the
positive and indicative form. One may search his writings in vain
for anything approaching the parable of the Good Samaritan, or the
words of Him who commended Elijah for replenishing the cruse and
barrel of the widow of Sarepta, and Elisha for healing Naaman the
Syrian leper, and Jonah for preaching the good news of God to the
Assyrians who had been aliens and oppressors. Lao Tsze, however,
went so far as to teach "return good for evil." When one of the
pupils of Confucius interrogated his Master concerning this, the
sage answered; "What then will you return for good? Recompense
injury with justice, and return good for good."</p>
<p>But if we do good only to those who do good to us, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>{129}</span> what
thanks have we? Do not the publicans the same? Behold how the
Heavenly Father does good alike unto all, sending rain upon the
just and unjust!</p>
<p>How Old Japan treated the foreigner is seen in the repeated
repulse, with powder and ball, of the relief ships which, under the
friendly stars and stripes, attempted to bring back to her shores
the shipwrecked natives of Nippon.<a id="footnotetag4-30" name=
"footnotetag4-30"></a><a href="#footnote4-30"><sup>30</sup></a>
Granted that this action may have been purely political and the
Government alone responsible for it&mdash;just as our un-Christian
anti-Chinese legislation is similarly explained&mdash;yet it is
certain that the sentiment of the only men in Japan who made public
opinion,&mdash;the Samurai of that day,&mdash;was in favor of this
method of meeting the alien.</p>
<p>In 1852 the American expedition was despatched to Japan for the
purpose of opening a lucrative trade and of extending American
influence and glory, but also unquestionably with the idea of
restoring shipwrecked Japanese as well as securing kind treatment
for shipwrecked American sailors, thereby promoting the cause of
humanity and international courtesy; in short, with motives that
were manifestly mixed.<a id="footnotetag4-31" name=
"footnotetag4-31"></a><a href="#footnote4-31"><sup>31</sup></a> In
the treaty pavilion there ensued an interesting discussion between
Commodore Perry and Professor Hayashi upon this very subject.</p>
<p>Perry truthfully complained that the dictates of humanity had
not been followed by the Japanese, that unnecessary cruelty had
been used against shipwrecked men, and that Japan's attitude toward
her neighbors and the whole world was that of an enemy and not of a
friend.</p>
<p>Hayashi, who was then probably the leading Confucianist in
Japan, warmly defended his countrymen <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>{130}</span> and
superiors against the charge of intentional cruelty, and denounced
the lawless character of many of the foreign sailors. Like most
Japanese of his school and age, he wound up with panegyrics on the
pre-eminence in virtue and humanity, above all nations, of the
Country Ruled by a Theocratic Dynasty, and on the glory and
goodness of the great Tokugawa family, which had given peace to the
land during two centuries or more.<a id="footnotetag4-32" name=

<p>It is manifest, however, that so far as this hostility to
foreigners, and this blind bigotry of "patriotism" were based on
Chinese codes of morals, as officially taught in Yedo, they
belonged as much to the old Confucianism as to the new. Wherever
the narrow philosophy of the sage has dominated, it has made Asia
Chinese and nations hermits. As a rule, the only way in which
foreigners could come peacefully into China or the countries which
she intellectually dominated was as vassals, tribute-bearers, or
"barbarians." The mental attitude of China, Korea, Annam and Japan
has for ages been that of the Jews in Herodian times, who set up,
between the Court of Israel and the Court of the Gentiles, their
graven stones of warning which read:<a id="footnotetag4-33" name=

<h2>CHAPTER V - CONFUCIANISM IN ITS PHILOSOPHICAL FORM</h2>
<h3>Japan's Millennium of Simple Confucianism.</h3>
<p>Having seen the practical working of the ethics of Confucianism,
especially in the old and simple system, let us now glance at the
developed and philosophical forms, which, by giving the educated
man of Japan a creed, made him break away from Buddhism and despise
it, while becoming often fanatically Confucian.</p>
<p>For a thousand years (from 600 to 1600 A.D.) the Buddhist
religious teachers assisted in promulgating the ethics of
Confucius; for during all this time there was harmony between the
various Buddhisms imported from India, Tibet, China and Korea, and
the simple undeveloped system of Chinese Confucianism. Slight
modifications were made by individual teachers, and emphasis was
laid upon this or that feature, while out of the soil of Japanese
feudalism were growths of certain virtues as phases of loyalty,
phenomenal beyond those in China. Nevertheless, during all this
time, the Japanese teachers of the Chinese ethic were as students
who did but recite what they learned. They simply transmitted,
without attempting to expand or improve.</p>
<p>Though the apparatus of distribution was early known, block
printing having been borrowed from the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>{134}</span> Chinese
after the ninth century, and movable types learned from the Koreans
and made use of in the sixteenth century,<a id="footnotetag5-1"
name="footnotetag5-1"></a><a href="#footnote5-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
the Chinese classics were not printed as a body until after the
great peace of Genna (1615). Nor during this period were
translations made of the classics or commentaries, into the
Japanese vernacular. Indeed, between the tenth and sixteenth
centuries there was little direct intercourse, commercial,
diplomatic or intellectual, between Japan and China, as compared
with the previous eras, or the decades since 1870.</p>
<p>Suddenly in the seventeenth century the intellect of Japan, all
ready for new surprises in the profound peace inaugurated by
Iy&eacute;yas[)u], received, as it were, an electric thrill. The
great warrior, becoming first a unifier by arms and statecraft,
determined also to become the architect of the national culture.
Gathering up, from all parts of the country, books, manuscripts,
and the appliances of intellectual discipline, he encouraged
scholars and stimulated education. Under his supervision the
Chinese classics were printed, and were soon widely circulated. A
college was established in Yedo, and immediately there began a
critical study of the texts and principal commentaries. The fall of
the Ming dynasty in China, and the accession of the Manchiu
Tartars, became the signal for a great exodus of learned Chinese,
who fled to Japan. These received a warm welcome, both at the
capital and in Yedo, as well as in some of the castle towns of the
Daimi[=o]s, among whom stand illustrious those of the province of
Mito.<a id="footnotetag5-2" name="footnotetag5-2"></a><a href=
"#footnote5-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>These men from the west brought not only ethics but philosophy;
and the fertilizing influences of these <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>{135}</span> scholars
of the Dispersion, may be likened to those of the exodus of the
Greek learned men after the capture of Constantinople by the Turks.
Confucian schools were established in most of the chief provincial
cities. For over two hundred years this discipline in the Chinese
ethics, literature and history constituted the education of the
boys and men of Japan. Almost every member of the Samurai classes
was thoroughly drilled in this curriculum. All Japanese social,
official, intellectual and literary life was permeated with the new
spirit. Their "world" was that of the Chinese, and all outside of
it belonged to "barbarians." The matrices of thought became so
fixed and the Japanese language has been so moulded, that even now,
despite the intense and prolonged efforts of thirty years of acute
and laborious scholarship, it is impossible, as we have said, to
find English equivalents for terms which were used for a century or
two past in every-day Japanese speech. Those who know most about
these facts, are most modest in attempting with English words to do
justice to Japanese thought; while those who know the least seem to
be most glib, fluent and voluminous in showing to their own
satisfaction, that there is little difference between the ethics of
Chinese Asia and those of Christendom.</p>
<h3>Survey of the Intellectual History of China.</h3>
<p>The Confucianism of the last quarter-millennium in Japan is not
that of her early centuries. While the Japanese for a thousand
years only repeated and recited&mdash;merely talking aloud in their
intellectual sleep but not reflecting&mdash;China was awake and
thinking hard. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id=
"page136"></a>{136}</span> Japan's continued civil wars, which
caused the almost total destruction of books and manuscripts,
secured also the triumph of Buddhism which meant the atrophy of the
national intellect. When, after the long feuds and battles of the
middle ages, Confucianism stepped the second time into the Land of
<i>Brave</i> Scholars, it was no longer with the simple rules of
conduct and ceremonial of the ancient days, nor was it as the ally
of Buddhism. It came like an armed man in full panoply of harness
and weapons. It entered to drive Buddhism out, and to defend the
intellect of the educated against the wiles of priestcraft. It was
a full-blown system of pantheistic rationalism, with a scheme of
philosophy that to the far-Oriental mind seemed perfect as a rule
both of faith and practice. It came in a form that was received as
religion, for it was not only morality "touched" but infused with
motion. Nor were the emotions kindled, those of the partisan only,
but rather also those of the devotee and the martyr. Henceforth
Buddhism, with its inventions, its fables, and its endless
dogmatism, was for the common people, for women and children, but
not for the Samurai. The new Confucianism came to Japan as the
system of Chu Hi. For three centuries this system had already held
sway over the intellect of China. For two centuries and a half it
has dominated the minds of the Samurai so that the majority of them
to-day, even with the new name Shizoku, are Confucianists so far as
they are anything.</p>
<p>To understand the origin of Buddhism we must know something of
the history and the previous religious and philosophical systems of
India, and so, if we are to appreciate modern "orthodox"
Confucianism, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id=
"page137"></a>{137}</span> we must review the history of China, and
see, in outline, at least, its literature, politics and philosophy
during the middle ages.</p>
<p>"Four great stages of literary and national development may be
pointed to as intervening (in the fifteen hundred years) between
the great sage and the age called that of the Sung-Ju,"<a id=
"footnotetag5-3" name="footnotetag5-3"></a><a href=
"#footnote5-3"><sup>3</sup></a> from the tenth to the fourteenth
century, in which the Confucian system received its modern form.
Each of them embraced the course of three or four centuries.</p>
<p>I. From the sixth to the third century before Christ the
struggle was for Confucian and orthodox doctrine, led by Mencius
against various speculators in morals and politics, with Taoist
doctrine continually increasing in acceptance.</p>
<p>II. The Han age (from B.C. 206 to A.D. 190) was rich in critical
expositors and commentators of the classics, but "the tone of
speculation was predominantly Taoist."</p>
<p>III. The period of the Six Dynasties (from A.D. 221 to A.D. 618)
was the golden age of Buddhism, when the science and philosophy of
India enriched the Chinese mind, and the wealth of the country was
lavished on Buddhist temples and monasteries. The faith of Shaka
became nearly universal and the Buddhists led in philosophy and
literature, founding a native school of Indian philosophy.</p>
<p>IV. The Tang period (from A.D. 618 to 905) marked by luxury and
poetry, was an age of mental inaction and enervating
prosperity.</p>
<p>V. The fifth epoch, beginning with the Sung Dynasty (from A.D.
960 to 1333) and lasting to our own time, was ushered in by a
period of intense mental energy. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page138" id="page138"></a>{138}</span> Strange to say (and most
interesting is the fact to Americans of this generation), the
immediate occasion of the recension and expansion of the old
Confucianism was a Populist movement.<a id="footnotetag5-4" name=
"footnotetag5-4"></a><a href="#footnote5-4"><sup>4</sup></a> During
the Tang era of national prosperity, Chinese socialists questioned
the foundations of society and of government, and there grew up a
new school of interpreters as well as of politicians. In the tenth
century the contest between the old Confucianism and the new
notions, broke out with a violence that threatened anarchy to the
whole empire.</p>
<p>One set of politicians, led by Wang (1021-1086), urged an
extension of administrative functions, including agricultural
loans, while the brothers Cheng (1032-1085, 1033-1107) reaffirmed,
with fresh intellectual power, the old orthodoxy.</p>
<p>The school of writers and party agitators, led by Szma Kwaug
(1009-1086)<a id="footnotetag5-5" name=
"footnotetag5-5"></a><a href="#footnote5-5"><sup>5</sup></a> the
historian, contended that the ancient principles of the sages
should be put in force. Others, the Populists of that age and land,
demanded the entire overthrow of existing institutions.</p>
<p>In the bitter contest which ensued, the Radicals and Reformers
temporarily won the day and held power. For a decade the experiment
of innovation was tried. Men turned things social and political
upside down to see how they looked in that position. So these stood
or oscillated for thirteen years, when the people demanded the old
order again. The Conservatives rose to power. There was no civil
war, but the Radicals were banished beyond the frontier, and the
country returned to normal government.</p>
<p>This controversy raised a landmark in the intellectual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id=
"page139"></a>{139}</span> history of China.<a id="footnotetag5-6"
name="footnotetag5-6"></a><a href="#footnote5-6"><sup>6</sup></a>
The thoughts of men were turned toward deep and acute inquiry into
the nature and use of things in general. This thinking resulted in
a literature which to-day is the basis of the opinions of the
educated men in all Chinese Asia. Instead of a sapling we now have
a mighty tree. The chief of the Chinese writers, the Calvin of
Asiatic orthodoxy, who may be said to have wrought Confucianism
into a developed philosophy, and who may be called the greatest
teacher of the mind, of modern China, Korea and Japan, is Chu Hi,
who reverently adopted the criticisms on the Chinese classics of
the brothers Cheng.<a id="footnotetag5-7" name=
"footnotetag5-7"></a><a href="#footnote5-7"><sup>7</sup></a> It is
evident that in Chu Hi's system, we have a body of thought which
may be called the result of Chinese reflection during a millennium
and a half. It is the ethics of Confucius transfused with the
mystical elements of Taoism and the speculations of Buddhism. As
the common people of China made an amalgam of the three religions
and consider them one, so the philosophers have out of these three
systems made one, calling that one Confucianism. The dominant
philosophy in Japan to-day is based upon the writings of Chu Hi (in
Japanese, Shu Shi) and called the system of T&eacute;i-Shu, which
is the Japanese pronunciation of the names of the Cheng brothers
and of Chu (Hi). It is a medley which the ancient sage could no
more recognize than would Jesus know much of the Christianity that
casts out devils in his name.</p>
<h3>Contrast between the Chinese and Japanese Intellect.</h3>
<p>Here we must draw a contrast between the Chinese and Japanese
intellect to the credit of the former; <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>{140}</span> China
made, Japan borrowed. While history shows that the Chinese mind,
once at least, possessed mental initiative, and the power of
thinking out a system of philosophy which to-day satisfies largely,
if not wholly, the needs of the educated Chinaman, there has been
in the Japanese mind, as shown by its history, apparently no such
vigor or fruitfulness. From the literary and philosophical points
of view, Confucianism, as it entered Japan, in the sixth century,
remained practically stationary for a thousand years.
Modifications, indeed, were made upon the Chinese system, and these
were striking and profound, but they were less developments of the
intellect than necessities of the case. The modifications were
made, as molten metal poured into a mould shaped by other hands
than the artist's own, rather than as clay made plastic under the
hand of a designer. Buddhism, being the dominant force in the
thoughts of the Japanese for at least eight hundred years,
furnished the food for the requirements of man on his intellectual
and religious side.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, it may be said that the Japanese, receiving
passively the Chinese classics, were content simply to copy and to
recite what they had learned. As compared with their audacity in
not only going beyond the teachings of Buddha, but in inventing
systems of Buddhism which neither Gautama nor his first disciples
could recognize, the docile and almost slavish adherence to ancient
Confucianism is one of the astonishing things in the history of
religions in Japan. In the field of Buddhism we have a luxuriant
growth of new and strange species of colossal weeds that overtower
and seem to have choked out whatever furze of original Buddhism
there was in Japan, while in the domain of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>{141}</span>
Confucianism there is a barren heath. Whereas, in China, the
voluminous literature created by commentators on Confucius and the
commentaries on the commentators suggests the hyperbole used by the
author of John's Gospel,<a id="footnotetag5-8" name=
"footnotetag5-8"></a><a href="#footnote5-8"><sup>8</sup></a> yet
there is probably nothing on Confucianism from the Japanese pen in
the thousand years under our review which is worth the reading or
the translation.<a id="footnotetag5-9" name=
"footnotetag5-9"></a><a href="#footnote5-9"><sup>9</sup></a> In
this respect the Japanese genius showed its vast capabilities of
imitation, adoption and assimilation.</p>
<p>As of old, Confucianism again furnished a Chinese wall, within
which the Japanese could move, and wherein they might find food for
the mind in all the relations of life and along all the lines of
achievement permitted them. The philosophy imported from China, as
shown again and again in that land of oft-changing dynasties,
harmonizing with arbitrary government, accorded perfectly with the
despotism of the Tokugawas, the "Tycoons" who in Yedo ruled from
1603 to 1868. Nothing new was permitted, and any attempt at
modification, enlargement, or improvement was not only frowned and
hissed down as impious innovation, but usually brought upon the
daring innovator the ban of the censor, imprisonment, banishment,
or death by enforced suicide.<a id="footnotetag5-10" name=
"footnotetag5-10"></a><a href="#footnote5-10"><sup>10</sup></a> In
Yedo, the centre of Chinese learning, and in other parts of the
country, there were, indeed, thinkers whose philosophy did not
always tally with what was taught by the orthodox,<a id=
"footnotetag5-11" name="footnotetag5-11"></a><a href=
"#footnote5-11"><sup>11</sup></a> but as a rule even when these men
escaped the ban of the censor, or the sword of the executioner,
they were but us voices crying in the wilderness. The great mass of
the gentry was orthodox, according to the standards of the
S&eacute;ido College, while the common people remained <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>{142}</span> faithful
to Buddhism. In the conduct of daily life they followed the
precepts which had for centuries been taught them by their
fathers.</p>
<h3>Philosophical Confucianism the Religion of the Samurai.</h3>
<p>What were the features of this modern Confucian philosophy,
which the Japanese Samurai exalted to a religion?<a id=
"footnotetag5-12" name="footnotetag5-12"></a><a href=
"#footnote5-12"><sup>12</sup></a> We say philosophy and religion,
because while the teachings of the great sage lay at the bottom of
the system, yet it is not true since the early seventeenth century,
that the thinking men of Japan have been satisfied with only the
original simple ethical rules of the ancient master. Though they
have craved a richer mental pabulum, yet they have enjoyed less the
study of the original text, than acquaintance with the commentaries
and communion with the great philosophical exponents, of the
master. What, then, we ask, are the features of the developed
philosophy, which, imported from China, served the Japanese Samurai
not only as morals but for such religion as he possessed or
professed?</p>
<p>We answer: The system was not agnostic, as many modern and
western writers assert that it is, and as Confucius, transmitting
and probably modifying the old religion, had made the body of his
teachings to be. Agnostic, indeed, in regard to many things wherein
a Christian has faith, modern Confucianism, besides being bitterly
polemic and hostile to Buddhism, is pantheistic.</p>
<p>Certain it is that during the revival of Pure Shint[=o] in the
eighteenth century, the scholars of the Shint[=o] school, and those
of its great rival, the Chinese, agreed <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>{143}</span> in making
loyalty<a id="footnotetag5-13" name="footnotetag5-13"></a><a href=
"#footnote5-13"><sup>13</sup></a> take the place of filial duty in
the Confucian system. To serve the cause of the Emperor became the
most essential duty to those with cultivated minds. The newer
Chinese philosophy mightily influenced the historians, Rai Sanyo
and those of the Mito school, whose works, now classic, really
began the revolution of 1868. By forming and setting in motion the
public opinion, which finally overthrew the Sh[=o]gun and
feudalism, restored the Emperor to supreme power, and unified the
nation, they helped, with modern ideas, to make the New Japan of
our day. The Shint[=o] and the Chinese teachings became amalgamated
in a common cause, and thus the philosophy of Chu Hi, mingling with
the nationalism and patriotism inculcated by Shint[=o], brought
about a remarkable result. As a native scholar and philosopher
observes, "It certainly is strange to see the Tokugawa rule much
shaken, if not actually overthrown, by that doctrine which
generations of able Sh[=o]guns and their ministers had earnestly
encouraged and protected. It is perhaps still more remarkable to
see the Mito clan, under many able and active chiefs, become the
centre of the Kinno<a id="footnotetag5-14" name=
"footnotetag5-14"></a><a href="#footnote5-14"><sup>14</sup></a>
movement, which was to result in the overthrow of the Tokugawa
family, of which it was itself a branch."</p>
<h3>A Medley of Pantheism.</h3>
<p>The philosophy of modern Confucianism is wholly pantheistic.
There is in it no such thing or being as God. The orthodox
pantheism of Old Japan means that everything in general is god, but
nothing in particular is God; that All is god, but not that God is
all. It is a "pantheistic medley."<a id="footnotetag5-15" name=
"footnotetag5-15"></a><a href="#footnote5-15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id=
"page144"></a>{144}</span>
<p>Chu Hi and his Japanese successors, especially Ky[=u]-so, argue
finely and discourse volubly about <i>Ki</i><a id="footnotetag5-16"
name="footnotetag5-16"></a><a href=
"#footnote5-16"><sup>16</sup></a> or spirit; but it is not Spirit,
or spiritual in the sense of Him who taught even a woman at the
well-curb at Sychar. It is in the air. It is in the earth, the
trees, the flowers. It comes to consciousness in man. His <i>Ri</i>
is the Tao of Lao Tsze, the Way, Reason, Law. It is formless,
invisible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ri is not separate from Ki, for then it were an empty abstract
thing. It is joined to Ki, and may be called, by nature, one
decreed, changeless Norm. It is the rule of Ki, the very centre,
the reason why Ki is Ki."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ten or Heaven is not God or the abode of God, but an
abstraction, a sort of Unknowable, or Primordial Necessity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The doctrine of the Sages knows and worships Heaven, and
without faith in it there is no truth. For men and things, the
universe, are born and nourished by Heaven, and the 'Way,' the
'ri,' that is in all, is the 'Way,' the 'ri' of Heaven.
Distinguishing root and branch, the heart is the root of Heaven and
the appearance, the revolution of the sun and moon, the order of
the stars, is the branch. The books of the sages teach us to
conform to the heart of Heaven and deal not with appearances."</p>
<p>"The teaching of the sages is the original truth and, given to
men, it forms both their nature and their relationships. With it
complete, naught else is needed for the perfect following of the
'Way.' Let then the child make its parents Heaven, the retainer,
his Lord, the wife her husband, and let each give up life for
righteousness. Thus will each serve for Heaven. But if we exalt
Heaven above parent or Lord, we shall come to think we can serve it
though they be disobeyed and like tiger or wolf shall rejoice to
kill them. To such fearful end does <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page145" id="page145"></a>{145}</span> the Western learning
lead.... Let each one die for duty, there is naught else we can
do."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus wrote Ohashi Junzo, as late as 1857 A.D., the same year in
which Townsend Harris entered Yedo to teach the practical
philosophy of Christendom, and the brotherhood of man as expressed
in diplomacy. Ohashi Junzo bitterly opposed the opening of Japan to
modern civilization and the ideas of Christendom. His book was the
swan-song of the dying Japanese Confucianism. Slow as is the dying,
and hard as its death may be, the mind of new Japan has laid away
to dust and oblivion the T&eacute;i-shu philosophy. "At present
they (the Chinese classics) have fallen into almost total neglect,
though phrases and allusions borrowed from them still pass current
in literature, and even to some extent in the language of every-day
life." S&eacute;ido, the great temple of Confucius in Tokyo, is now
utilized as an educational Museum.<a id="footnotetag5-17" name=
"footnotetag5-17"></a><a href="#footnote5-17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>A study of this subject and of comparative religion, is of
immediate practical benefit to the Christian teacher. The preacher,
addressing an audience made up of educated Japanese, who speaks of
God without describing his personality, character, or attributes as
illustrated in Revelation, will find that his hearers receive his
term as the expression for a bundle of abstract principles, or a
system of laws, or some kind of regulated force. They do, indeed,
make some reference to a "creator" by using a rare word.
Occasionally, their language seems to touch the boundary line on
the other side of which is conscious intelligence, but nothing
approaching the clearness and definiteness of the early Chinese
monotheism of the pre-Confucian classics is to be
distinguished.<a id="footnotetag5-18" name=
"footnotetag5-18"></a><a href="#footnote5-18"><sup>18</sup></a> The
modern Japanese <span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id=
"page146"></a>{146}</span> long ago heard joyfully the words,
"Honor the gods, but keep them far from you," and he has done
it.</p>
<p>To love God would no more occur to a Japanese gentleman than to
have his child embrace and kiss him. Whether the source and
fountain of life of which they speak has any Divine Spirit, is very
uncertain, but whether it has, or has not, man need not obey, much
less worship him. The universe is one, the essence is the same. Man
must seek to know his place in the universe; he is but one in an
endless chain; let him find his part and fulfil that part; all else
is vanity. One need not inquire into the origins or the ultimates.
Man is moved by a power greater than himself; he has no real
independence of his own; everything has its rank and place; indeed,
its rank and place is its sole title to a separate existence. If a
man mistakes his place he is a fool, he deserves punishment.</p>
<h3>The Ideals of a Samurai.</h3>
<p>Out of his place, man is not man. Duty is more important than
being. Nearly everything in our life is fixed by fate; there may
seem to be exceptions, because some wicked men are prosperous and
some righteous men are wretched, but these are not real exceptions
to the general rule that we are made for our environment and fitted
to it. And then, again, it may be that our judgments are not
correct. Let the heart be right and all is well. Let man be
obedient and his outward circumstance is nothing, having no
relation to his joy or happiness. Even when as to his earthly body
man passes away, he is not destroyed; the drop again becomes part
of the sea, the spark re-enters the flame, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>{147}</span> and his
life continues, though it be not a conscious life. In this way man
is in harmony with the original principle of all things. He
outlasts the universe itself.</p>
<p>Hence to a conscientious Samurai there is nothing in this world
better than obedience, in the ideal of a true man. What he fears
most and hates most is that his memory may perish, that he shall
have no seed, that he shall be forgotten or die under a cloud and
be thought treacherous or cowardly or base, when in reality his
life was pure and his motives high. "Better," sang Yoshida Shoin,
the dying martyr for his principles, "to be a crystal and to be
broken, than to be a tile upon the housetop and remain."</p>
<p>So, indeed, on a hundred curtained execution grounds, with the
dirk of the suicide firmly grasped and about to shed their own
life-blood, have sung the martyrs who died willingly for their
faith in their idea of Yamato Damashii.<a id="footnotetag5-19"
name="footnotetag5-19"></a><a href=
"#footnote5-19"><sup>19</sup></a> In untold instances in the
national history, men have died willingly and cheerfully, and women
also by thousands, as brave, as unflinching as the men, so that the
story of Japanese chivalry is almost incredible in its awful
suicides. History reveals a state of society in which cool
determination, desperate courage and fearlessness of death in the
face of duty were quite unique, and which must have had their base
in some powerful though abnormal code of ethics.</p>
<p>This leads us to consider again the things emphasized by
Japanese as distinct from Chinese and Korean<a id="footnotetag5-20"
name="footnotetag5-20"></a><a href=
"#footnote5-20"><sup>20</sup></a> Confucianism, and to call
attention to its fruits, while at the same time we note its
defects, and show wherein it failed. We shall then show how this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id=
"page148"></a>{148}</span> old system has already waxed old and is
passing away. Christ has come to Japan, and behold a new heaven and
a new earth!</p>
<h3>New Japan Makes Revision.</h3>
<p>First. For sovereign and minister, there are coming into vogue
new interpretations. This relation, if it is to remain as the
first, will become that of the ruler and the ruled. Constitutional
government has begun; and codes of law have been framed which are
recognizing the rights of the individual and of the people. Even a
woman has rights before the law, in relation to husband, parents,
brothers, sisters and children. It is even beginning to be thought
that children have rights. Let us hope that as the rights are
better understood the duties will be equally clear.</p>
<p>It is coming to pass in Japan that even in government, the
sovereign must consult with his people on all questions pertaining
to their welfare. Although, thus far the constitutional government
makes the ministers responsible to the Sovereign instead of to the
Diet, yet the contention of the enlightened men and the liberal
parties is, that the ministers shall be responsible to the Diet.
The time seems at hand when the sovereign's power over his people
will not rest on traditions more or less uncertain, on history
manufactured by governmental order, on mythological claims based
upon the so-called "eternal ages," on prerogatives upheld by the
sword, or on the supposed grace of the gods, but will be
"broad-based upon the people's will." The power of the rulers will
be derived from the consent of the governed. The Emperor will
become the first and chief servant of the nation.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id=
"page149"></a>{149}</span>
<p>Revision and improvement of the Second Relation will make filial
piety something more real than that unto which China has attained,
or Japan has yet seen, or which is yet universally known in
Christendom. The tyranny of the father and of the older brother,
and the sale of daughters to shame, will pass away; and there will
arise in the Japanese house, the Christian home.</p>
<p>It would be hard to say what Confucianism has done for woman. It
is probable that all civilizations, and systems of philosophy,
ethics and religion, can be well tested by this criterion&mdash;the
position of woman. Confucianism virtually admits two standards of
morality, one for man, another for woman.<a id="footnotetag5-21"
name="footnotetag5-21"></a><a href=
"#footnote5-21"><sup>21</sup></a> In Chinese Asia adultery is
indeed branded as one of the vilest of crimes, but in common idea
and parlance it is a woman's crime, not man's. So, on the other
hand, chastity is a female virtue, it is part of womanly duty, it
has little or no relation to man personally. Right revision and
improvement of the Third Relation will abolish concubinage. It will
reform divorce. It will make love the basis of marriage. It will
change the state of things truthfully pictured in such books as the
Genji Monogatari, or Romance of Prince Genji, with its examples of
horrible lust and incests; the Kojiki or Ethnic scripture, with its
na&iuml;ve accounts of filthiness among the gods; the Onna Dai
Gaku, Woman's Great Study, with its amazing subordination and moral
slavery of wife and daughter; and The Japanese Bride, of
yesterday&mdash;all truthful pictures of Japanese life, for the
epoch in which each was written. These books will become the
forgotten curiosities of literature, known only to the
arch&aelig;ologist.</p>
<p>Improvement and revision of the Fourth Relation, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>{150}</span> will
bring into the Japanese home more justice, righteousness, love and
enjoyment of life. It will make possible, also, the cheerful
acceptance and glad practice of those codes of law common in
Christendom, which are based upon the rights of the individual and
upon the idea of the greatest good to the greatest number. It will
help to abolish the evils which come from primogeniture and to
release the clutch of the dead hand upon the living. It will
decrease the power of the graveyard, and make thought and care for
the living the rule of life. It will abolish sham and fiction, and
promote the cause of truth. It will hasten the reign of
righteousness and love, and beneath propriety and etiquette lay the
basis of "charity toward all, malice toward none."</p>
<p>Revision with improvement of the Fifth Relation hastens the
reign of universal brotherhood. It lifts up the fallen, the
down-trodden and the outcast. It says to the slave "be free," and
after having said "be free," educates, trains, and lifts up the
brother once in servitude, and helps him to forget his old estate
and to know his rights as well as his duties, and develops in him
the image of God. It says to the hinin or not-human, "be a man, be
a citizen, accept the protection of the law." It says to the eta,
"come into humanity and society, receive the protection of law, and
the welcome of your fellows; let memory forget the past and charity
make a new future." It will bring Japan into the fraternity of
nations, making her people one with the peoples of Christendom, not
through the empty forms of diplomacy, or by the craft of her
envoys, or by the power of her armies and navies reconstructed on
modern principles, but by patient <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page151" id="page151"></a>{151}</span> education and unflinching
loyalty to high ideals. Thus will Japan become worthy of all the
honors, which the highest humanity on this planet can bestow.</p>
<h3>The Ideal of Yamato Damashii Enlarged.</h3>
<p>In this our time it is not only the alien from Christendom, with
his hostile eye and mordant criticism, who is helping to undermine
that system of ethics which permitted the sale of the daughter to
shame, the introduction of the concubine into the family and the
reduction of woman, even though wife and mother, to nearly a
cipher. It is not only the foreigner who assaults that philosophy
which glorified the vendetta, kept alive private war, made revenge
in murder the sweetest joy of the Samurai and suicide the gate to
honor and fame, subordinated the family to the house, and
suppressed individuality and personality. It is the native
Japanese, no longer a hermit, a "frog in the well, that knows not
the great ocean" but a student, an inquirer, and a critic, who
assaults the old ethical and philosophical system, and calls for a
new way between heaven and earth, and a new kind of Heaven in which
shall be a Creator, a Father and a Saviour. The brain and pen of
New Japan, as well as its heart, demand that the family shall be
more than the house and that the living members shall have greater
rights as well as duties, than the dead ancestors. They claim that
the wife shall share responsibility with the husband, and that the
relation of husband and wife shall take precedence of that of the
father and son; that the mother shall possess equal authority with
the father; that the wife, whether she be mother or not, shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id=
"page152"></a>{152}</span> not be compelled to share her home with
the concubine; and that the child in Japan shall be born in the
home and not in the herd. The sudden introduction of the Christian
ideas of personality and individuality has undoubtedly wrought
peril to the framework of a society which is built according to the
Confucian principles; but faith in God, love in the home, and
absolute equality before the law will bring about a reign of
righteousness such as Japan has never known, but toward the
realization of which Christian nations are ever advancing.</p>
<p>Even the old ideal of the Samurai embodied in the formula Yamato
Damashii will be enlarged and improved from its narrow limits and
ferocious aspects, when the tap-root of all progress is allowed to
strike into deeper truth, and the Sixth Relation, or rather the
first relation of all, is taught, namely, that of God to Man, and
of Man to God. That this relation is understood, and that the
Samurai ideal, purified and enlarged, is held by increasing numbers
of Japan's brightest men and noblest women, is shown in that superb
Christian literature which pours from the pens of the native men
and women in the Japanese Christian churches. Under this flood of
truth the old obstacles to a nobler society are washed away, while
out of the enriched soil rises the new Japan which is to be a part
of the better Christendom that is to come. Christ in Japan, as
everywhere, means not destruction, but fulfilment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI - THE BUDDHISM OF NORTHERN ASIA</h2>
<h3>Pre-Buddhistic India.</h3>
<p>Does the name of Gautama, the Buddha, stand for a sun-myth or
for a historic personage? One set of scholars and writers,
represented by Professor Kern,<a id="footnotetag6-1" name=
"footnotetag6-1"></a><a href="#footnote6-1"><sup>1</sup></a> of
Leyden, thinks the Buddha a mythical personage. Another school,
represented by Professor T. Rhys Davids,<a id="footnotetag6-2"
name="footnotetag6-2"></a><a href="#footnote6-2"><sup>2</sup></a>
declares that he lived in human flesh and breathed the air of
earth. We accept the historical view as best explaining the
facts.</p>
<p>In order to understand a religion, in its origin at least, we
must know some of the conditions out of which it arose. Buddhism is
one of the protestantisms of the world. Yet, is not every religion,
in one sense, protestant? Is it not a protest against something to
which it opposes a difference? Every new religion, like a growing
plant, ignores or rejects certain elements in the soil out of which
it springs. It takes up and assimilates, also, other elements not
used before, in order to produce a flower or fruit different from
other growths out of the same soil. Yet whether the new religion be
considered as a development, fulfilment, or protest, we must know
its historical perspective or background. To understand the origin
of Buddhism, one of the best preparations is to <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>{156}</span> read the
history of India and especially of the thought of her many
generations; for the landmarks of the civilizations of India, as a
Hindu may proudly say, are its mighty literatures. At these let us
glance.<a id="footnotetag6-3" name="footnotetag6-3"></a><a href=
"#footnote6-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The age of the Vedas extends from the year 2000 to 1400 B.C.,
and the history of this early India is wonderfully like that of
America. During this era, the Hindus, one of the seven Aryan tribes
of which the Persian, Greek, Latin, Celtic, Sclav and Teutonic form
the other six, descending from the mid-Asian plateau, settled the
Punjab in Northwest India. They drove the dark-skinned aborigines
before them and reclaimed forest and swamp to civilization, making
the land of the seven rivers bright with agriculture and brilliant
with cities. This was the glorious heroic age of joyous life and
conquest, when men who believed in a Heavenly Father<a id=
"footnotetag6-4" name="footnotetag6-4"></a><a href=
"#footnote6-4"><sup>4</sup></a> made the first epoch of Hindu
history.</p>
<p>Then followed the epic age, 1400-1000 B.C., when the area of
civilization was extended still farther down the Ganges Valley, the
splendor of wealth, learning, military prowess and social life
excelling that of the ancestral seats in the Punjab. Amid
differences of wars and diplomacy with rivalries and jealousies, a
common sacred language, literature and religion with similar social
and religious institutions, united the various nations together. In
this time the old Vedas were compiled into bodies or collections,
and the Brahmanas and the Upanishads, besides the great epic poems,
the Mahabharata and the Ramayana were composed.</p>
<p>The next, or rationalistic epoch, covers the period from 1000
B.C. to 320 B.C., when the Hindu expansion <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>{157}</span> had
covered all India, that is, the peninsula from the Himalayas to
Cape Comorin. Then, all India, including Ceylon, was Hinduized,
though in differing degrees; the purest Aryan civilization being in
the north, the less pure in the Ganges Valley and south and east,
while the least Aryan and more Dravidian was in Bengal, Orissa, and
India south of the Kistna River.</p>
<p>This story of the spread of Hindu civilization is a brilliant
one, and seems as wonderful as the later European conquest of the
land, and of the other "Indians" of North America from the Atlantic
to the Pacific. Beside the conquests in material civilization of
these our fellow-Aryans (who were the real Indians, and who spoke
the language which is the common ancestor of our own and of most
European tongues), what impresses us most of all, in these Aryans,
is their intellectual energy. The Hindus of the rationalistic age
made original discoveries. They invented grammar, geometry,
arithmetic, decimal notation, and they elaborated astronomy,
medicine, mental philosophy and logic (with syllogism) before these
sciences were known or perfected in Greece. In the seventh century
before Christ, Kapila taught a system of philosophy, of which that
of the Europeans, Schopenhaur and Hartmann, seems largely a
reproduction.</p>
<p>Following this agnostic scheme of thought, came, several
centuries later, the dualistic Yoga<a id="footnotetag6-5" name=
"footnotetag6-5"></a><a href="#footnote6-5"><sup>5</sup></a> system
in which the chief feature is the conception of Deity as a means of
final emancipation of the human soul from further transmigration,
and of union with the Universal Spirit or World Soul. There is,
however, perhaps no sadder chapter in the history of human thought
than the story of the later degeneration of the Yoga system
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id=
"page158"></a>{158}</span> into one of bloody and cruel rites in
India, and of superstition in China.</p>
<p>Still other systems followed: one by Gautama, of the same clan
or family of the later Buddha, who develops inference by the
construction of syllogism; while Kanada follows the atomic
philosophy in which the atoms are eternal, but the aggregates
perishable by disintegration.</p>
<p>Against these schools, which seemed to be dangerous "new
departures," orthodox Hindus, anxious for their ancient beliefs and
practices as laid down in the Vedas, started fresh systems of
philosophy, avowedly more in consonances with their ancestral
faith. One system insisted on the primitive Vedic ritual, and
another laid emphasis on the belief in a Universal Soul first
inculcated in the Upanishads.</p>
<h3>Conditions out of which Buddhism Arose.</h3>
<p>Whatever we may think of these schools of philosophy, or the
connection with or indebtedness of Gautama, the Buddha, to them,
they reveal to us the conceptions which his contemporaries had of
the universe and the beings inhabiting it. These were honest human
attempts to find God. In them the various beings or six conditions
of sentient existence are devas or gods; men; asuras or monsters;
pretas or demons; animals; and beings in hell. Furthermore, these
schools of Hindu philosophy show us the conditions out of which
Buddhism arose, furnish us with its terminology and technical
phrases, reveal to us what the reformer proposed to himself to do,
and, what is perhaps still more important, show us the types to
which <span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id=
"page159"></a>{159}</span> Buddhism in its degeneration and
degradation reverted. The strange far-off oriental words which
today scholars discuss, theosophists manipulate, and charlatans
employ as catchpennies were common words in the every-day speech of
the Hindu people, two or three thousand years ago.</p>
<p>Glancing rapidly at the condition of religion in the era
ushering in the birth of Buddha, we note that the old joyousness of
life manifested in the Vedic hymns is past, their fervor and glow
are gone. In the morning of Hindu life there was no caste, no fixed
priesthood, and no idols; but as wealth, civilization, easy and
settled life succeeded, the taste for pompous sacrifices conducted
by an hereditary priestly caste increased. Greater importance was
laid upon the detail of the ceremonies, the attention of the
worshipper being turned from the deities "to the minuti&aelig; of
rites, the erection of altars, the fixing of the proper
astronomical moments for lighting the fire, the correct
pronunciation of prayers, and to the various requisite acts
accompanying a sacrifice."<a id="footnotetag6-6" name=
"footnotetag6-6"></a><a href="#footnote6-6"><sup>6</sup></a> In the
chapter of decay which time wrote and literature reflects, we find
"grotesque reasons given for every minute rite, dogmatic
explanation of texts, penances for every breach of form and rule,
and elaborate directions for every act and moment of the
worshipper."</p>
<p>The literature shows a degree of credulity and submission on the
part of the people and of absolute power on the part of the
priests, which reminds us of the Middle Ages in Europe. The old
inspiring wars with the aborigines are over. The time of bearing a
noble creed, meaning culture and civilization as against savagery
and idolatry, is past, and only intestine quarrels <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>{160}</span> and local
strife have succeeded. The age of creative literature is over, and
commentators, critics and grammarians have succeeded. Still more
startling are the facts disclosed by literary history. The liquid
poetry has become frozen prose; the old flaming fuel of genius is
now slag and ashes. We see Hindus doing exactly what Jewish rabbis,
and after them Christian schoolmen and dogma-makers, did with the
old Hebrew poems and prophecies. Construing literally the prayers,
songs and hopes of an earlier age, they rebuild the letter of the
text into creeds and systems, and erect an amazing edifice of
steel-framed and stone-cased tradition, to challenge which is
taught to be heresy and impiety. The poetical similes used in the
Rig Vedas have been transformed into mythological tales. In the
change of language the Vedas themselves are unreadable, except by
the priests, who fatten on popular beliefs in the transmigration of
souls and in the power of priestcraft to make that transmigration
blissful&mdash;provided liberal gifts are duly forthcoming.
Idolatry and witchcraft are rampant. Some saviour, some light was
needed.</p>
<h3>Buddhism a Logical Product of Hindu Thought.</h3>
<p>At such a time, probably 557 B.C., was born Shaka, of the Muni
clan, at Kapilavastu, one hundred miles northeast of Benares. We
pass over the details<a id="footnotetag6-7" name=
"footnotetag6-7"></a><a href="#footnote6-7"><sup>7</sup></a> of the
life of him called Prince, Lord, Lion of the Tribe of Shaka, and
Saviour; of his desertion of wife and child, called the first Great
Renunciation; of his struggles to obtain peace; of his
enlightenment or Buddhahood; of his second or Greater Renunciation;
of merit on account <span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id=
"page161"></a>{161}</span> of austerities; and give the story told
in a mountain of books in various tongues, but condensed in a
paragraph by Romesh Chunder Dutt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"At an early age, Prince Gautama left his royal home, and his
wife, and new-born child, and became a wanderer and a mendicant, to
seek a way of salvation for man. Hindu rites, accompanied by the
slaughter of innocent victims, repelled his feelings. Hindu
philosophy afforded him no remedy, and Hindu penances and
mortifications proved unavailing after he had practised them for
years. At last, by severe contemplation, he discovered the long
coveted truth; a holy and calm life, and benevolence and love
toward all living creatures seemed to him the essence of religion.
Self-culture and universal love&mdash;this was his
discovery&mdash;this is the essence of Buddhism."<a id=
"footnotetag6-8" name="footnotetag6-8"></a><a href=
"#footnote6-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From one point of view Buddhism was the logical continuance of
Aryan Hindoo philosophy; from another point of view it was a new
departure. The leading idea in the Upanishads is that the object of
the wise man should be to know, inwardly and consciously, the Great
Soul of all; and by this knowledge his individual soul would become
united to the Supreme Being, the true and absolute self. This was
the highest point reached in the old Indian philosophy<a id=
"footnotetag6-9" name="footnotetag6-9"></a><a href=
"#footnote6-9"><sup>9</sup></a> before Buddha was born.</p>
<p>So, looking at Buddhism in the perspective of Hindu history and
thought, we may say that it is doubtful whether Gautama intended to
found a new religion. As, humanly speaking, Saul of Tarsus saved
Christianity from being a Jewish sect and made it universal, so
Gautama extricated the new enthusiasm of humanity from the priests.
He made Aryan religion the property of all India. What had been a
rare monopoly as narrow as Judaism, he made the inheritance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id=
"page162"></a>{162}</span> of all Asia. Gautama was a protestant
and a reformer, not an agnostic or skeptic. It is more probable
that he meant to shake off Brahmanism and to restore the pure and
original form of the Aryan religion of the Vedas, as far as it was
possible to do so. In one sense, Buddhism was a revolt against
hereditary and sacerdotal privilege&mdash;an attack of the people
against priestcraft. The Buddha and his disciples were levellers.
In a different age and clime, but along a similar path, they did a
work analogous to that of the so-called Anabaptists in Europe and
Independents in England, centuries later.</p>
<p>It is certain, however, that Buddhism has grown logically out of
ancient Hinduism. In its monastic feature&mdash;one of its most
striking characteristics&mdash;we see only the concentration and
reduction to system, of the old life of the ascetics and religious
mendicants recognized and respected by Hinduism. For centuries the
Buddhist monks and nuns were regarded in India as only a new sect
of ascetics, among many others which flourished in the land.</p>
<p>The Buddhist doctrine of karma, or in Japanese, <i>ingwa</i>, of
cause and effect, whereby it is taught that each effect in this
life springs from a cause in some previous incarnation, and that
each act in this life bears its fruit in the next, has grown
directly out of the Hindu idea of the transmigration of souls. This
idea is first inculcated in the Upanishads, and is recognized in
Hindu systems of philosophy.</p>
<p>So also the Buddhist doctrine of Nirvana, or the attainment of a
sinless state of existence, has grown out of the idea of final
union of the individual soul with the Universal Soul, which is also
inculcated in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id=
"page163"></a>{163}</span> Upanishads. Yet, as we shall see, the
Buddhists were, in the eyes of the Brahmans, atheists, because in
the ken of these new levellers gods and men were put on the same
plane. Brahmanism has never forgiven Buddhism for ignoring the
gods, and the Hindoos finally drove out the followers of Gautama
from India. It eventuated that after a millenium or so of Buddhism
in India, the old gods, Brahma, Indra, etc., which at first had
been shut out from the ken of the people, by Gautama, found their
places again in the popular faith of the Buddhists, who believed
that the gods as well as men, were all progressing toward the
blessed Nirvana&mdash;that sinless life and holy calm, which is the
Buddhist's heaven and salvation.</p>
<p>It is certainly very curious, and in a sense amusing, to find
flourishing in far-off Japan the old gods of India, that one would
suppose to have been utterly dead and left behind in oblivion. As
acknowledged devas or kings and bodhisattvas or soon-to-be Buddhas,
not a few once defunct Hindu gods, utterly unknown to early
Buddhism, have forced their way into the company of the elect.
Though most of them have not gained the popularity of the
indigenous deities of Nippon, they yet attract many worshippers.
They remind one that amid the coming of the sons of Elohim before
Jehovah, "the satan" came also.<a id="footnotetag6-10" name=
"footnotetag6-10"></a><a href="#footnote6-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>From another point of view Buddhism was a new religion; for it
swept away and out of the field of its vision the whole of the
World or Universal Soul theory. "It proclaimed a salvation which
each man could gain for himself and by himself, in this world
during this life, without the least reference to God, or to gods,
either great or small." "It placed the first <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>{164}</span>
importance on knowledge; but it was no longer a knowledge of God,
it was a clear perception of the real nature as they supposed it to
be of men and things." In a word, Gautama never reached the idea of
a personal self-existent God, though toward that truth he groped.
He was satisfied too soon.<a id="footnotetag6-11" name=
"footnotetag6-11"></a><a href="#footnote6-11"><sup>11</sup></a> His
followers were even more easily satisfied with abstractions. When
Gautama saw the power over the human heart of inward culture and of
love to others, he obtained peace, he rested on certainty, he
became the Buddha, that is, the enlightened. Perhaps he was not the
first Buddhist. It may be that the historical Gautama, if so he is
worthy to be called, merely made the sect or the new religion
famous. Hardly a religion in the full sense of the word, Buddhism
did not assume the r&ocirc;le of theology, but sought only to know
men and things. In one sense Buddhism is atheism, or rather,
atheistic humanism. In one sense, also, the solution of the mystery
of God, of life, and of the universe, which Gautama and his
followers attained, was one of skepticism rather than of faith.
Buddhism is, relatively, a very modern religion; it is one of the
new faiths. Is it paradoxical to say that the Buddhists are
"religious atheists?"</p>
<h3>The Buddhist Millennium in India.</h3>
<p>Let us now look at the life of the Founder. Day after day, the
pure-souled teacher attracted new disciples while he with alms-bowl
went around as mendicant and teacher. Salvation merely by
self-control, and love without any rites, ceremonies, charms,
priestly powers, gods or miracles, formed the burden of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id=
"page165"></a>{165}</span> teachings. "Thousands of people left
their homes, embraced the holy order and became monks, ignoring
caste, and relinquishing all worldly goods except the bare
necessaries of life, which they possessed and enjoyed in common."
Probably the first monastic <i>system</i> of the world, was that of
the Indian Buddhists.</p>
<p>The Buddha preached the good news during forty-five years. After
his death, five hundred of his followers assembled at Rajagriha and
chanted together the teachings of Gautama, to fix them in memory. A
hundred years later, in 377 B.C., came the great schism among the
Buddhists, out of which grew the divisions known as Northern and
Southern Buddhism. There was disagreement on ten points. A second
council was therefore called, and the disputed points determined to
the satisfaction of one side. Thereupon the seceders went away in
large numbers, and the differences were never healed; on the
contrary, they have widened in the course of ages.</p>
<p>The separatists began what may be called the Northern Buddhisms
of Nepal, Tibet, China, Korea and Japan. The orthodox or Southern
Buddhists are those of Ceylon, Burma and Siam. The original canon
of Southern Buddhism is in Pali; that of Northern Buddhism is in
Sanskrit. The one is comparatively small and simple; the other
amazingly varied and voluminous. The canon of Southern scripture is
called the Hinayana, the Little or Smaller Vehicle; the canon of
Northern Buddhism is named the Mahayana or Great Vehicle. Possibly,
also, besides the Southern and Northern Buddhisms, the Buddhism of
Japan may be treated by itself and named Eastern Buddhism.</p>
<p>In the great council called in 242 B.C., by King Asoka,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id=
"page166"></a>{166}</span> who may be termed the Constantine of
Buddhism, the sacred texts were again chanted. It was not until the
year 88 B.C. in Ceylon, six hundred years after Gautama, that the
three Pitakas, Boxes or Baskets, were committed to writing in the
Pali language. In a word, Buddhism knows nothing of sacred
documents or a canon of scripture contemporary with its first
disciples.</p>
<p>The splendid Buddhist age of India lasted nearly a thousand
years, and was one of superb triumphs in civilization. It was an
age of spiritual emancipation, of freedom from idol worship, of
nobler humanity and of peace.<a id="footnotetag6-12" name=
"footnotetag6-12"></a><a href="#footnote6-12"><sup>12</sup></a> It
was followed by the Puranic epoch and the dark ages. Then Buddhism
was, as some say, "driven out" from the land of its birth, finding
new expansion in Eastern and Northern Asia, and again, a still more
surprising development in the ultima-Thule of the Asiatic
continent, Japan. There is now no Buddhism in India proper, the
faith being represented only in Ceylon and possibly also on the
main land, by the sect of the Jains, and peradventure in Persia by
Babism which contains elements from three religions.<a id=
"footnotetag6-13" name="footnotetag6-13"></a><a href=
"#footnote6-13"><sup>13</sup></a> Like Christianity, Buddhism was
"driven out" of its old home to bless other nations of the world.
It is probably far nearer the truth to say that Buddhism was never
expelled from India, but rather that it died by disintegration and
relapse.<a id="footnotetag6-14" name="footnotetag6-14"></a><a href=
"#footnote6-14"><sup>14</sup></a> It had become Brahmanism again.
The old gods and the old idol-worship came back. It is in Japan
that the ends of the earth, eastern and western civilization, and
the freest and fullest or at least the latest developments of
Christianity and of Buddhism, have met.</p>
<p>In its transfer to distant lands and its developments throughout
Eastern Asia, the faith which had originated <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>{167}</span> in India
suffered many changes. Dividing into two great branches, it became
a notably different religion according as it moved along the
southern, the northern, or the eastern channel. By the vehicle of
the Pali language it was carried to Ceylon, Siam, Burma, Cambodia
and the islands of the south; that is, to southern or peninsular
and insular Asia. Here there is little evidence of any striking
departure from the doctrines of the Pali Pitakas; and, as Southern
Buddhism does not greatly concern us in speaking of the religions
of Japan, we may pass it by. For although the books and writings
belonging to Southern Buddhism, and comprehended under the formula
of the Hinayana or Smaller Vehicle, have been studied in China,
Korea and Japan, yet they have had comparatively little influence
upon doctrinal, ritualistic, or missionary development in Chinese
Asia.</p>
<p>Astonishingly different has been the case with the Northern
Buddhisms which are those of Nepal, Tibet, Mongolia, Manchuria,
China, Korea and Japan. As luxuriant as the evolutions of political
and dogmatic Christianity and as radical in their departures from
the primitive simplicity of the faith, have been these forms of
Buddhist doctrine, ritual and organization. We cannot now dwell
upon the wonderful details of the vast and complicated system,
differing so much in various countries. We pass by, or only glance
at, the philosophy of the Punjaub; the metaphysics of
Nepal&mdash;with its developments into what some writers consider
to be a close approach to monotheism, and others, indeed,
monotheism itself; the system of Lamaism in Tibet, which has
paralleled so closely the development of the papal hierarchy; the
possibly two thousand <span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id=
"page168"></a>{168}</span> years' growth and decay of Chinese
Buddhism; the varieties of the Buddhism of Mongolia&mdash;almost
swamped in the Shamanistic superstitions of these dwellers on the
plains; the astonishing success, quick ripening, decay, and almost
utter annihilation, among the learned and governing classes, of
Korean Buddhism;<a id="footnotetag6-15" name=
"footnotetag6-15"></a><a href="#footnote6-15"><sup>15</sup></a> and
study in detail only Eastern or Japanese Buddhism.</p>
<p>We shall in this lecture attempt but two things:</p>
<p>I. A summary of the process of thought by which the chief
features of the Northern Buddhisms came into view.</p>
<p>II. An outline of the story of Japanese Buddhism during the
first three centuries of its existence.</p>
<h3>The Development of Northern Buddhism</h3>
<p>Leaving the early Buddha legends and the solid ground of
history, the makers of the newer Buddhist doctrines in Nepal
occupied themselves with developing the theory of Buddhahood and of
the Buddhas;<a id="footnotetag6-16" name=
"footnotetag6-16"></a><a href="#footnote6-16"><sup>16</sup></a> for
we must ever remember that Buddha<a id="footnotetag6-17" name=
"footnotetag6-17"></a><a href="#footnote6-17"><sup>17</sup></a> is
not a proper name, but a common adjective meaning enlightened, from
the root to know, perceive, etc. They made constant and marvellous
additions to the primitive doctrine, giving it a momentum which
gathered force as the centuries went on; and, as propaganda, it
moved against the sun.</p>
<p>This development theory ran along the line of
<i>personification</i>. Not being satisfied with "the wheel of the
law," it personified both the hub and the spokes. It began with the
spirit of kindness out of which all human virtues rise, and by the
power of which the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id=
"page169"></a>{169}</span> Buddhist organization will conquer all
sin and unbelief and become victorious throughout the world. This
personification is called the Maitreya Buddha, the unconquerable
one, or the future Buddha of benevolence, the Buddha who is yet to
come. Here was a tremendous and revolutionary movement in the new
faith, the beginning of a long process. It was as though the
Christians had taken the particular attributes, justice, mercy,
etc., of God and, after personifying each one, deified it, thus
multiplying gods.</p>
<p>What was the soil for the new sowing, and what was the harvest
to be reaped in due time?</p>
<p>With many thousands of India Buddhists whose minds were already
steeped in Brahministic philosophy and mythology, who were more
given to speculation and dreaming than to self-control and moral
culture, and who mourned for the dead gods of Hinduism, the soil
was already prepared for a growth wholly abnormal to true Buddhism,
but altogether in keeping with the older Brahministic philosophies
from which these dreamers had been but partially converted to
Buddhism.<a id="footnotetag6-18" name=
"footnotetag6-18"></a><a href="#footnote6-18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>The seed is found in the doctrine which already forms part of
the system of the Little Vehicle, when it tells of the personal
Buddhas and the Buddhas elect, or future Buddhas. In the Jataka
stories, or Birth tales, "the Buddha elect" is the title given to
each of the beings, man, angel, or animal, who is held to be a
Bodhisattva, or the future Buddha in one of his former births. The
title Bodhisattva<a id="footnotetag6-19" name=
"footnotetag6-19"></a><a href="#footnote6-19"><sup>19</sup></a> is
the name given to a being whose Karma will produce other beings in
a continually ascending scale of goodness until it becomes vested
in a Buddha. Or, in the more common use of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>{170}</span> the word,
a Bodhisattva (Japanese bosatsu) is a being whose essence has
become intelligence, and who will have to pass through human
existence once more only before entering Nirvana.</p>
<p>In Southern Buddhist temples, the pure white image of Maitreya
is sometimes found beside the idol representing Gautama or the
historical Buddha. While in Southern Buddhism the idea of this
possibility of development seems to have been little seized upon
and followed up, in Northern Buddhism as early as 400 A.D. the
worship of two Buddhas elect named Manjusri and Avalokitesvara, or
personified Wisdom and Power, had already become general.
Manjusri,<a id="footnotetag6-20" name=
"footnotetag6-20"></a><a href="#footnote6-20"><sup>20</sup></a> the
Great Being or "Prince Royal," is the personification of wisdom,
and especially of the mystic religious insight which has produced
the Great Vehicle or canon of Northern Buddhism; or, as a Japanese
author says, the third collection of the Tripitaka was that made by
Manjusri and Maitreya. Avalokitesvara,<a id="footnotetag6-21" name=
"footnotetag6-21"></a><a href="#footnote6-21"><sup>21</sup></a> the
Lord of View or All-sided One, is the personification of power, the
merciful protector and preserver of the world and of men. Both are
frequently and voluminously mentioned in the Saddharma
Pundarika,<a id="footnotetag6-22" name=
"footnotetag6-22"></a><a href="#footnote6-22"><sup>22</sup></a> in
which the good law is made plain by flowers of rhetoric, and of
which we shall have occasion frequently to speak. Manjusri is the
mythical author of this influential work,<a id="footnotetag6-23"
name="footnotetag6-23"></a><a href=
"#footnote6-23"><sup>23</sup></a> the twenty-fourth chapter being
devoted to a glorification of the character, the power, and the
advantages to be derived from the worship of Avalokitesvara.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id=
"page171"></a>{171}</span>
<h3>The Creation of Gods.</h3>
<p>Possibly the name of Manjusri may be derived from that of the
Indian mendicant, the traditional introducer of Buddhism and its
accompanying civilization into Nepal. The Tibetans identify him
with the minister of a great King Strongstun, who lived in the
seventh century of our era and who was the great patron of Buddhism
into Tibet. He is the founder of that school of thought which ended
in the Great Vehicle,&mdash;the literature of Northern
Buddhism.<a id="footnotetag6-24" name=
"footnotetag6-24"></a><a href="#footnote6-24"><sup>24</sup></a>
From Nepal to Japan, in the books of the Northern Buddhists there
is certainly much confusion between the metaphysical being and the
legendary civilizer and teacher of Nepal. The other name,
Avalokitesvara, which means the Lord of View, "the lord who looks
down from on high," instead of being a purely metaphysical
invention, may he only an adaptation of one epithet of Shiva, which
meant Master of View.</p>
<p>Later and by degrees the attributes were separated and each one
was personified. For example, the power of Avalokitesvara was
separated from his protecting care and providence. His power was
personified as the bearer of the thunder-bolt, or the
lightning-handed one; and this new personification added to the two
other Buddhas elect, made a triad, the first in Northern Buddhism.
In this triad, the thunder-bolt holder was Vagrapani; Manjusri was
the deified teacher; and Avalokitesvara was the Spirit of the
Buddhas present in the church. Before many centuries had elapsed,
these imaginary beings, with a few others, had become gods to whom
men prayed; and thus Buddhism became a <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>{172}</span> religion
with some kind of theism,&mdash;which Gautama had expressly
renounced.</p>
<p>If any one wants proof of this reversion into the old religions
of India, he has only to notice that the name, given to the new god
made by personification of the attribute of power, Vagrapani, or
Vadjradhara, or the bearer of the thunder-bolt, had formerly been
used as an epithet of the old fire-god of the Vedas, Indra.</p>
<p>It were tedious to recount all the steps in the further
development of Northern Buddhism.<a id="footnotetag6-25" name=
"footnotetag6-25"></a><a href="#footnote6-25"><sup>25</sup></a>
Suffice it to say, that out of ideas and principles set forth in
the earlier Buddhism, and under the generating force reborn from
old Brahminism, the Dhyani Buddhas (that is the Buddhas evolved out
of the mind in mystic trance) were given their elect Buddhas; and
so three sets of five were co-ordinated.<a id="footnotetag6-26"
name="footnotetag6-26"></a><a href=
"#footnote6-26"><sup>26</sup></a> That is, first, five
pre-penultimate Buddhas; then their Bodhisattvas or penultimate
Buddhas; and then the ultimate or human Buddhas, of which Gautama
was one. Or, first abstraction; then pre-human effluence; then
emanation.</p>
<p>All this multiplication of beings is unknown to Southern
Buddhism, unknown to the Saddharma Pundarika, and very probably
unknown also to the Chinese pilgrims who visited India in the fifth
and seventh centuries. Professor Rhys Davids, in his compact little
manual of Buddhism, says:<a id="footnotetag6-27" name=
"footnotetag6-27"></a><a href="#footnote6-27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Among those hypothetical beings&mdash;the creations of a sickly
scholasticism, hollow abstractions without life or
reality&mdash;the fourth Amitabha, 'Immeasurable Light,' whose
Bodhisatwa is Avalokitesvara, and whose emanation is Gautama,
occupies of course the highest and most important rank. Surrounded
by innumerable Bodhisatwas, he sits enthroned under a Bo-tree in
Sukhavati, <i>i.e.</i>, the Blissful, a paradise of heavenly joys,
whose <span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id=
"page173"></a>{173}</span> description occupies whole tedious books
of the so-called Great Vehicle. By this theory, each of the five
Buddhas has become three, and the fourth of these five sets of
three is the second Buddhist Trinity, the belief in which must have
arisen after the seventh century of our era."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Buddhism has been called the light of Asia, and Gautama its
illuminator; but certainly the light has not been pure, nor the
products of its illumination wholesome. Pardon an illustration. In
Christian churches and cathedrals of Europe, there is still a great
prejudice against the use of pipes, and of gas made from coal,
because of the machinery and of the impure emanations. The
prejudice is a wholesome one; for we all know that most of the
elements forming common illuminating gas are worthless except to
convey the very small amount of light-giving material, and that
these elements in combustion vitiate the air and give off
deleterious products which corrode, tarnish and destroy. Now though
Buddhist doctrine may have been the light of India, yet to reach
the Northern and Eastern nations of Asia it had, apparently, to be
adulterated for conveyance, as much as is the illuminating gas in
our cities. From the first, Northern Buddhism showed a wonderful
affinity, not only for Brahministic superstitions and speculations,
but for almost everything else with which it came in contact in
countries beyond India. Instead of combating, it absorbed. It
adapted itself to circumstances, and finding certain beliefs
prevalent among the people, it imbibed them, and thus gained by
accretion until its bulk, both of beliefs and of disciples, was in
the inverse ratio of its purity. Even to-day, the occult theosophy
of "Isis Unveiled," and of the school of writers such <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>{174}</span> as
Blavatsky, Olcott, etc., seems to be a perfectly logical product of
the Northern Buddhisms, and may be called one of them; yet it is
simply a repetition of what took place centuries ago. Most of the
primitive beliefs and superstitions of Nepal and Tibet were
absorbed in the ever hungry and devouring system of Buddhistic
scholasticism.</p>
<h3>The Making of a Pantheon.</h3>
<p>Let us glance again at this Nepal Buddhism. In the tenth century
we find what at first seems to be a growth out of Polytheism into
Monotheism, for a new Being, to whom the attributes of infinity,
self-existence and omniscience are ascribed, is invented and named
Adi-Buddha, or the primordial Buddha. According to the speculations
of the thinkers, he had evolved himself out of the five
Dhyani-Buddhas by the exercise of the five meditations, while each
of these had evolved out of itself by wisdom and contemplation, the
corresponding Buddhas elect. Again, each of the latter evolved out
of his own essence a material world,&mdash;our present world being
the fourth of these, that is of Avaloki. One almost might consider
that this setting forth of the primordial Buddha was real
Monotheism; but on looking more carefully one sees that it is as
little real Monotheism as was possible in the system of Gnosticism.
Indeed the force of evolution could not stop here; for, since even
this primordial Buddha rested upon Ossa of hypothesis piled upon
Pelion of hypothesis, there must be other hypotheses yet to come,
and so the Tantra system, a compound of old Brahminism with the
magic and witchcraft and Shamanism of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>{175}</span> Northern
Asia burst into view. As this was to travel into Japan and be
hailed as purest Buddhism, let us note how this tenth century
Tantra system grew up. To see this clearly, is to look upon the
parable of the man with the unclean spirit being acted out on a
vast scale in history.</p>
<p>In the sixth century of our era, one Asanga, or Asamga, wrote
the Shastra, called the Shastra Yoga-chara Bhumi.<a id=
"footnotetag6-28" name="footnotetag6-28"></a><a href=
"#footnote6-28"><sup>28</sup></a> With great dexterity he erected a
sort of clearing-house for both the corrupt Brahminism and corrupt
Buddhism of his day, and exchanging and rearranging the gods and
devils in both systems, he represented them as worshippers and
supporters of the Buddha and Avalokitesvara. In such a system, the
old primitive Buddhism of the noble eight-fold path of
self-conquest and pure morals was utterly lost. Instead of that,
the worshipper gave his whole powers to obtaining occult potencies
by means of magic phrases and magic circles. Then grew up whole
forests of monasteries and temples, with an outburst of devilish
art representing many-headed and many-eyed and many-handed idols on
the walls, on books, on the roadside, with manifold charms and
phrases the endless repetitions of which were supposed to have
efficacy with the hypothetical being who filled the heavens. That
was <i>the</i> age of idols for China as well as for India; and the
old Chinese house, once empty, swept and garnished by Confucianism,
was now filled with a mob of unclean spirits each worse than the
first. With more courageous logic than the more matter-of-fact
Chinese, the Tibetan erected his prayer-mills<a id=
"footnotetag6-29" name="footnotetag6-29"></a><a href=
"#footnote6-29"><sup>29</sup></a> and let the winds of heaven and
the flowing waters continually multiply his prayers and holy
syllables. And these inventions <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page176" id="page176"></a>{176}</span> were duly imported into
Japan, and even now are far from being absent.<a id=
"footnotetag6-30" name="footnotetag6-30"></a><a href=
"#footnote6-30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Passing over for the present the history of Buddhism in
China,<a id="footnotetag6-31" name="footnotetag6-31"></a><a href=
"#footnote6-31"><sup>31</sup></a> suffice it to say that the
Buddhism which entered Japan from Korea in the sixth century, was
not the simple atheism touched with morality, the bald skepticism
or benevolent agnosticism of Gautama, but a religion already over a
thousand years old. It was the system of the Northern Buddhists.
These, dissatisfied, or unsatisfied, with absorption into a
passionless state through self-sacrifice and moral discipline, had
evolved a philosophy of religion in which were gods, idols and an
apparatus of conversion utterly unknown to the primitive faith.</p>
<h3>Buddhism Already Corrupted when brought to Japan.</h3>
<p>This sixth century Buddhism in Japan was not the army with
banners, which was introduced still later with the luxuriances of
the fully developed system, its paradise wonderfully like
Mohammed's and its over-populated pantheon. It was, however, ready
with the necessary machinery, both material and mental, to make
conquest of a people which had not only religious aspirations, but
also latent aesthetic possibilities of a high order. As in its
course through China this Northern Buddhism had acted as an
all-powerful absorbent of local beliefs and superstitions, so in
Japan it was destined to make a more remarkable record, and, not
only to absorb local ideas but actually to cause the indigenous
religion to disappear.</p>
<p>Let us inquire who were the people to whom Buddhism, when
already possessed of a millenium of history, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>{177}</span> entered
its Ultima Thule in Eastern Asia. At what stage of mutual growth
did Buddhism and the Japanese meet each other?</p>
<p>Instead of the forty millions of thoroughly homogeneous people
in Japan&mdash;according to the census of December 31,
1892&mdash;all being loyal subjects of one Emperor, we must think
of possibly a million of hunters, fishermen and farmers in more or
less warring clans or tribes. These were made up of the various
migrations from the main land and the drift of humanity brought by
the ocean currents from the south; Ainos, Koreans, Tartars and
Chinese, with probably some Malay and Nigrito stock. In the central
part of Hondo, the main island, the Yamato tribe dominated, its
chief being styled Sum&eacute;ru-mikoto, or Mikado. To the south
and southwest, the Mikado's power was only more or less felt, for
the Yamato men had a long struggle in securing supremacy. Northward
and eastward lay great stretches of land, inhabited by unsubdued
and uncivilized native tribes of continental and most probably of
Korean origin, and thus more or less closely akin to the Yamato
men. Still northward roamed the Ainos, a race whose ancestral seats
may have been in far-off Dravidian India. Despite the constant
conflicts between the Yamato people who had agriculture and the
beginnings of government, law and literature, and their less
civilized neighbors, the tendency to amalgamation was already
strong. The problem of the statesman, was to extend the sway of the
Mikado over the whole Archipelago.</p>
<p>Shint[=o] was, in its formation, made use of as an engine to
conquer, unify and civilize all the tribes. In one sense, this
conquest of men having lower forms of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>{178}</span> faith, by
believers in the Kami no Michi, or Way of the Gods, was analogous
to the Aryan conquest of India and the Dravidians. However this may
be, the energy and valor displayed in these early ages formed the
ideal of Yamato Damashii (The Spirit of unconquerable Japan), which
has so powerfully influenced the modern Japanese. We shall see,
also, how grandly Buddhism also came to be a powerful force in the
unification of the Japanese people. At first, the new faith would
be rejected as an alien invader, stigmatized as a foreign religion,
and, as such, sure to invoke the wrath of the native gods. Then
later, its superiority to the indigenous cult would be seen both by
the wise and the practically minded, and it would be welcomed and
enjoyed.</p>
<h3>The Inviting Field.</h3>
<p>Never had a new religion a more inviting field or one more sure
of success, than had Buddhism on stepping from the Land of Morning
Dawn to the Land of the Rising Sun. Coming as a gorgeous, dazzling
and disciplined array of all that could touch the imagination,
stimulate the intellect and move the heart of the Japanese, it was
irresistible. For the making of a nation, Shint[=o] was as a donkey
engine, compared to the system of furnaces, boilers, shaft and
propeller of a ten-thousand-ton steel cruiser, moved by the
energies of a million years of sunbeam force condensed into coal
and released again through transmigration by fire.</p>
<p>All accounts in the vernacular Japanese agree, that their
Butsu-d[=o] or Buddhism was imported from Korea. In the sixteenth
year of K&eacute;itai, the twenty-seventh <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>{179}</span> Mikado
(of the list made centuries after, and the eleventh after the
impossible line of the long-lived or mythical Mikados), A.D. 534,
it is said that a man from China brought with him an image of
Buddha into Yamato, and setting it up in a thatched cottage
worshipped it. The people called it "foreign-country god." Visitors
discussed with him the religion of Shaka, as the Japanese call
Shakyamuni, and some little knowledge of Buddhism was gained, but
no notable progress was made until A.D. 552, which is generally
accepted and celebrated as the year of the introduction of the
faith into Japan. Then a king of Hiaksai in Korea, sent over to the
court and to the Mikado golden images of the Buddha and of the
triad of "precious ones," with Sutras and sacred books. These holy
relics are believed to be still preserved in the famous temple of
Zenk[=o]ji,<a id="footnotetag6-32" name=
"footnotetag6-32"></a><a href="#footnote6-32"><sup>32</sup></a>
belonging to the temple of the Tendai Sect at Nagano in Northern
Japan, this shrine being dedicated to Amida and his two followers
Kwannon (Avalokitesvara) and Dai-s&eacute;i-shi (Mahastanaprapta).
This group of idols, as the custodian of the shrine will tell you,
was made by Shaka himself out of gold, found at the base of the
tree which grows at the centre of the universe. After remaining in
Korea for eleven hundred and twelve years, it was brought to Japan.
Mighty is the stream of pilgrims which continually sets toward the
holy place. A common proverb declares that even a cow can find her
way thither.</p>
<p>In A.D. 572 and again in 584, new images, sutras and teachers
came over from another part of Korea. The Mikado called a council
to determine what should be done with the idols, to the worship of
which he was himself inclined; but a majority were against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id=
"page180"></a>{180}</span> idea of insulting the native gods by
receiving the presents and thus introducing a foreign religion. The
minister of state, however, one Soga no Inam&eacute;, expressed
himself in favor of Buddhism, and put the images in his country
house which he converted into a temple. When, soon after, the land
was afflicted with a pestilence, the opponents of the new faith
attributed it to the wrath of the gods at the hospitality given to
the new idols. War broke out, fighting took place, and the Buddhist
temple was burned and the idols thrown into the river, near Osaka.
Great portents followed, and the enemies of Buddhism were, it is
said, burned up by flames descending from heaven.</p>
<p>The tide then turned in favor of the Indian faith, and Soga
rebuilt his temple. Priests and missionaries were invited to come
over from Korea, being gladly furnished by the allies of Japan from
the state of Shinra, and Buddhism again flourished at the court,
but not yet among the people. Once more, fighting broke out; and
again the temple of the alien gods was destroyed, only to be
rebuilt again. The chief champion of Buddhism was the son of a
Mikado, best known by his posthumous title, Sh[=o]toku,<a id=
"footnotetag6-33" name="footnotetag6-33"></a><a href=
"#footnote6-33"><sup>33</sup></a> who all his life was a vigorous
defender and propagator of the new faith. Through his influence, or
very probably through the efforts of the Korean missionaries, the
devastating war between the Japanese and Koreans was ended. In the
peace which followed, notable progress was made through the vigor
of the missionaries encouraged by the regent Sh[=o]toku, so that at
his death in the year A.D. 621, there were forty-six temples, and
thirteen hundred and eighty-five priests, monks and nuns in Japan.
Many of the most famous temples, which are now <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>{181}</span> full of
wealth and renown, trace their foundations to this era of
Sh[=o]toku and of his aunt, the Empress Suiko (A.D. 593-628), who
were friendly to the new religion. Sh[=o]toku may be almost called
the founder of Japanese Buddhism. Although a layman, he is
canonized and stands unique in the Pantheon of Eastern Buddhism,
his image being prominently visible in thousands of Japanese
temples.</p>
<p>Legend, in no country more luxurious than in Japan, tells us
that the exotic religion made no progress until Amida, the
boundlessly Merciful One, assuming the shape of a concubine of the
imperial prince who afterward became the Mikado Yom&eacute;, gave
birth to Sh[=o]toku, who was himself Kwannon or the goddess of
mercy in human form; and that when he grew up, he took to wife an
incarnation of the Buddha elect, Mahastana-prapta, or in Japanese
Dai-s&eacute;i-shi, whose idol is honored at Zenk[=o]ji.</p>
<h3>The New Faith Becomes Popular.</h3>
<p>Then Buddhism became popular, passing out from the narrow circle
of the court to be welcomed by the people. In A.D. 623, monks came
over directly from China, and we find mentioned two sects, the
Sanron and the J[=o]jitsu, which are no longer extant in Japan. In
about A.D. 650 the fame of Yuan Chang (Hiouen Thsang) the Chinese
pilgrim to India, or the holy land, reached-Japan; and his
illustrious example was enthusiastically followed. History now
frequently repeated itself. The Japanese monk, D[=o]sh[=o], crossed
the seas to China to gaze upon the face and become the pupil of
that illustrious Chinese pilgrim, who had seen <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>{182}</span> Buddha
Land. Later on, other monks crossed to the land of Sinim, until we
find that in this and succeeding centuries, hundreds of Japanese in
their frail junks, braved the dangers of the stormy ocean, in order
to study Sanskrit, to read the old scriptures, to meet the new
lights of learning or revelation, and to become versed in the
latest fashions of religion. We find the pilgrims returning and
founding new sects or sub-sects, and stimulating by their
enthusiasm the monks and the home missionaries. In the year A.D.
700 the custom of cremation was introduced. This wrought not only a
profound change in customs, but also became the seed of a rich crop
of superstitions; since out of the cremated bodies of the saints
came forth the <i>shari</i> or, in Sanskrit, <i>sarira</i>. These
hard substances or pellets, preserved in crystal cabinets, are
treated as holy gems or relics. Thus venerated, they become the
nuclei of cycles of fairy lore.</p>
<p>In A.D. 710, the great monastery at Nara was founded; and here
we must notice or at least glance at the great throng of civilizing
influences that came in with Buddhism, and at the great army of
artists, artisans and skilled men and women of every sort of trade
and craft. We note that with the building of this great Nara
monastery came another proof of improvement and the added element
of stability in Japanese civilization. The ancient dread which the
Japanese had, of living in any place where a person had died was
passing away. The nomad life was being given up. The successor of a
dead Mikado was no longer compelled to build himself a new capital.
The traveller in Japan, familiar with the ancient poetry of the
Many[=o]-shu, finds no fewer than fifty-eight sites<a id=
"footnotetag6-34" name="footnotetag6-34"></a><a href=
"#footnote6-34"><sup>34</sup></a> as <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page183" id="page183"></a>{183}</span> the early homes of the
Japanese monarchy. Once occupying the proud position of imperial
capitals, they are now for the most part mere hamlets, oftentimes
mere names, with no visible indication of former human habitation;
while the old rivers or streams once gay with barges filled with
silken-robed lords and ladies, have dried up to mere washerwomen's
runnels. For the first time after the building of this Buddhist
monastery, the capital remained permanent, Nara being the imperial
residence during seventy-five years. Then beautiful Ki[=o]to was
chosen, and remained the residence of successive generations of
emperors until 1868. In A.D. 735, we read of the K&eacute;gon sect.
Two years later a large monastery, with a seven-storied pagoda
alongside of it, was ordered to be built in every province. These,
with the temples and their surroundings, and with the wayside
shrines beginning to spring up like exotic flowers, made a striking
alteration in the landscape of Japan. The Buddhist scriptures were
numerously copied and circulated among the learned class, yet
neither now nor ever, except here and there in fragments, were they
found among the people. For, although the Buddhist canon has been
repeatedly imported, copied by the pen and in modern times printed,
yet no Japanese translation has ever been made. The methods of
Buddhism in regard to the circulation of the scriptures are those,
not of Protestantism but of Roman Catholicism.</p>
<p>In the same year, the Mikado called for contributions from all
the people for the building of a colossal image of the Buddha,
which was to be of bronze and gilded. Yet, fearing that the
Shint[=o] gods might be offended, a skilful priest named
Giyoku,&mdash;probably <span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id=
"page184"></a>{184}</span> the same man who introduced the potter's
wheel into Japan,&mdash;was sent to the shrine of the Sun-goddess
in Is&eacute; to present her with a shari or relic of the Buddha,
and find out how she would regard his project. After seven days and
nights of waiting, the chapel doors flew open and the loud-voiced
oracle was interpreted in a favorable sense. The night following
the return of the priest, the Mikado dreamed that the sun-goddess
appeared to him in her own form and said "The sun is Birushana"
(Vairokana). This meant that the chief deity of the Japanese
proclaimed herself an avatar or incarnation of one of the old Hindu
gods.<a id="footnotetag6-35" name="footnotetag6-35"></a><a href=
"#footnote6-35"><sup>35</sup></a> She also approved the project of
the image; and in this same year, 759, native gold was found in
Japan, which sufficed for the gilding of the great idol that, after
eleven hundred years and many vicissitudes, still stands, the glory
of a multitude of pilgrims.</p>
<p>In A.D. 754 a famous priest, who introduced the new Ritsu Sect,
was able to convert the Mikado and obtain four hundred converts in
the imperial court. Thirteen years later, another tremendous
triumph of Buddhism was scored and a deadly blow at Shint[=o] was
struck. The Buddhist priests persuaded the Mikados to abandon their
ancient title of Sumeru and adopt that of Tenn[)o]; (Heavenly King
or Tenshi) Son of Heaven, after the Chinese fashion. At the same
time it was taught that the emperor could gain great merit and
sooner become a Buddha, by retiring from the active cares of the
throne and becoming a monk, with the title of H[=o]-[=o], or
Cloistered Emperor. This innovation had far-reaching consequences,
profoundly altering the status of the Mikado, giving sensualism on
the one hand and priestcraft on the other, their coveted
opportunity, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id=
"page185"></a>{185}</span> changing the ruler of the nation from an
active statesman into a recluse and the recluse into a pious monk,
or a licentious devotee, as the case might be. It paved the way for
the usurpation of the government by the unscrupulous soldier, "the
man on horseback," who was destined to rule Japan for seven hundred
years, while the throne and its occupant were in the shadow. One of
a thousand proofs of the progress of the propaganda scheme is seen
in the removal of the Shint[=o] temple which had stood at Nikk[=o],
and the erection in its place of a Buddhist temple. In A.D. 805 the
famous Tendai, and in 806 the powerful Shingon Sect were
introduced. All was now ready in Japan for the growth not only of
one new Buddhism, but of several varieties among the Northern
Buddhisms which so arouse the astonishment of those who study the
simple Pali scriptures that contain the story of Gautama, and who
know only the southern phase of the faith, that is to Asia,
relatively, what Christianity is to Europe. We say relatively, for
while Buddhism made Chinese Asia gentle in manners and kind to
animals, it covered the land with temples, monasteries and images;
on the other hand the religion of Jesus filled Europe not only with
churches, abbeys, monasteries and nunneries, but also with
hospitals, orphan asylums, lighthouses, schools and colleges.
Between the fruits of Christendom and Buddhadom, let the world
judge.</p>
<h3>Survey and Summary.</h3>
<p>To sum up: Buddhism is the humanitarian's, and also the
skeptic's, solution of the problem of the universe. Its three great
distinguishing characteristics are <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page186" id="page186"></a>{186}</span> atheism, metempsychosis and
absence of caste. It was in its origin pure democracy. As against
despotic priesthood and oppressive hierarchy, it was
congregational. Theoretically it is so yet, though far from being
so practically. It is certainly sacerdotal and aristocratic in
organization. As in any other system which has so vast a hierarchy
with so many grades of honor and authority, its theory of democracy
is now a memory. First preached in a land accursed by caste and
under spiritual and secular oppressions, it acknowledged no caste,
but declared all men equally sinful and miserable, and all equally
capable of being freed from sin and misery through Buddhahood, that
is, knowledge or enlightenment.<a id="footnotetag6-36" name=
"footnotetag6-36"></a><a href="#footnote6-36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>The three-fold principle laid down by Gautama, and now in dogma,
literature, art and worship, a triad or formal trinity, is, Buddha,
the attainment of Buddha-hood, or perfect enlightenment, through
meditation and benevolence; Karma, the law of cause and effect; and
Dharma, discipline or order; or, the Lord, the Law and the Church.
Paying no attention to questions of cosmogony or theogony, the
universe is accepted as an ultimate fact. Matter is eternal.
Creation exists but not a Creator. All is god, but God is left out
of consideration. The gods are even less than Buddhas. Humanity is
glorified and the stress of all teaching is upon this life. In a
word: a sinless life, attainable by man, through his own exertions
in this world, above all the powers or beings of the universe, is
the essence of original Buddhism. Original Nirvana meant death
which ends all, extinction of existence.</p>
<p>Gautama's immediate purpose was to emancipate himself and his
followers from the fetters of Brahminism. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>{187}</span> He tried
to leave the world of Hindu philosophy behind him and to escape
from it.</p>
<p>Did he succeed? Partially.</p>
<p>Buddha hoped also to rise above the superstitions of the common
people, but in this he was again only partially successful.<a id=
"footnotetag6-37" name="footnotetag6-37"></a><a href=
"#footnote6-37"><sup>37</sup></a> "The clouds returned after the
rain." The old dead gods of Brahminism came back under new names
and forms. The malarial exhalations of corrupt Brahmanistic
philosophy, continually poisoned the atmosphere which Buddha's
disciples breathed. Still worse, as his religion transmigrated into
other lands, it became itself a history of transformation, until
to-day no religion on earth seems to be such a kaleidoscopic
phantasmagoria. Polytheism is rampant over the greater part of the
Buddhist world to-day. In the larger portion of Chinese Asia,
pantheism dominates the mind. In modern Babism,&mdash;a mixture of
Mohammedanism, Christianity and Buddhism,&mdash;there are streaks
of dualism. If Monotheism has ever dawned on the Buddhist world, it
has been in fitful pulses as in auroral flashes, soon to leave
darkness darker.</p>
<p>For us is this lesson: Buddhism, brought face to face with the
problem of the world's evil and possible improvement, evades it;
begs the whole question at the outset; prays: "Deliver us from
existence. Save us from life and give us as little as possible of
it." Christianity faces the problem and flinches not; orders
advance all along the line of endeavor and prays: "Deliver us from
evil;" and is ever of good cheer, because Captain and leader says:
"I have overcome the world." Go, win it for me. "I have come that
they might have life, and that they might have it more
abundantly."</p>

is manifested by the impermanence of human beings. But yet whenever
necessary I will hereafter make my appearance from time to time as
a god, a sage, or a Buddha."&mdash;Last words of Shaka the Buddha,
in Japanese biography.</p>
<p>"It is our opinion that Buddhism cannot long hold its ground,
and that Christianity must finally prevail throughout all Japan....
Now, when Buddhism and Christianity are in conflict for the
ascendency, this indifference of the Japanese people to the
difference of sects is a great disadvantage to Buddhism. That they
should worship Jesus Christ with the same mind as they do

<h2>CHAPTER VII - RIY[=O]BU, OR MIXED BUDDHISM</h2>
<h3>Syncretism in Religion.</h3>
<p>Two centuries and a half of Buddhism in Japan, showed the
leaders and teachers of the Indian faith that complete victory over
the whole nation was yet very far off. The court had indeed been
invaded and won. Even the Mikado, the ecclesiastical head of
Shint[=o], and the incarnation and vicar of the heavenly gods, had
not only embraced Buddhism, but in many instances had shorn the
hair and taken the vows of the monk. Yet the people clung
tenaciously to their old traditions, customs and worship; for their
gods were like themselves and indeed were of themselves, since
Shint[=o] is only a transfiguration of Japanese life. In the
Japanese of those days we can trace the same traits which we behold
in the modern son of Nippon, especially his intense patriotism and
his warlike tendencies. To convert these people to the peaceful
dogmas of Siddartha and to make them good Buddhists, something more
than teaching and ritual was necessary. It was indispensable that
there should be complete substitution, all along the ruts and paths
of national habit, and especially that the names of the gods and
the festivals should be Buddhaized.</p>
<p>Popular customs are nearly immortal and ineradicable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id=
"page192"></a>{192}</span> Though wars may come, dynasties rise and
fall, and convulsions in nature take place, yet the people's
manners and amusements are very slow in changing. If, in the
history of Christianity, the European missionaries found it
necessary in order to make conquest of our pagan forefathers, to
baptize and re-name without radically changing old notions and
habits, so did it seem equally indispensable that in Japan there
should be some system of reconciliation of the old and the new,
some theological revolution, which should either fulfil, absorb, or
destroy Shint[=o].</p>
<p>In the histories of religions in Western Asia, Northern Africa
and Europe, we are familiar with efforts at syncretism. We have
seen how Philo attempted to unite Hebrew righteousness and Greek
beauty, and to harmonize Moses and Plato. We know of Euhemerus, who
thought he read in the old mythologies not only the outlines of
real history, but the hieroglyphics of legend and tradition, truth
and revelation.<a id="footnotetag7-1" name=
"footnotetag7-1"></a><a href="#footnote7-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
Students of Church history are well aware that this principle of
interpretation was followed only too generously by Tertullian,
Clement of Alexandria, Lactantius, Chrysostom and others of the
Church Fathers. Indeed, it would be hard to find in any of the
great religions of the world an utter absence of syncretism, or the
union of apparently hostile religious ideas. In the Thousand and
One Nights, we have an example in popular literature. We see that
the ancient men of India, Persia and pre-Mohammedan Arabia now act
and talk as orthodox Mussulmans. In matters pertaining to art and
furniture, the statue of Jupiter in Rome serves for St. Peter, and
in Japan that of the Virgin and child for the Buddha and his
mother.<a id="footnotetag7-2" name="footnotetag7-2"></a><a href=
"#footnote7-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id=
"page193"></a>{193}</span>
<p>What, however, chiefly concerns the critic and student of
religions is to inquire how far the process has been natural, and
the efforts of those who have brought about the union have been
honest, and their motives pure. The Bible pages bear witness, that
Israelites too often tried to make the same fountain give forth
sweet waters and bitter, and to grow thistles and grapes on the
same stem, by uniting the cults of Jehovah and the Baalim. King
Solomon's enterprises in the same direction are more creditable to
him as a politician than as a worshipper.<a id="footnotetag7-3"
name="footnotetag7-3"></a><a href="#footnote7-3"><sup>3</sup></a>
In the history of Christianity one cannot commend the efforts
either of the Gnostics or the neo-Platonists, nor always justify
the medieval missionaries in their methods. Nor can we accurately
describe as successful the ingenuity of Vossius, the Dutch
theologian, who, following the scheme of Euhemerus, discovered the
Old Testament patriarchs in the disguise of the gods of Paganism.
Nor, even though Germany be the land of learning, can the
clear-headed scholar agree with some of her rationalists, who are
often busy in the same field of industry, setting forth wild
criticism as "science."</p>
<h3>The Kami and the Buddhas.</h3>
<p>In Japan, to solve the problem of reconciliation between the
ancient traditions of the divine ancestors and the dogmas of the
Indian cult, it was necessary that some master spirit, profoundly
learned in the two Ways, of the Kami and of the Buddhas, should be
bold, and also as it seems, crafty and unscrupulous. To convert a
line of theocratic emperors, whose authority was derived from their
alleged divine origin and sacerdotal <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page194" id="page194"></a>{194}</span> character, into patrons and
propagandists of Buddhism, and to transform indigenous Shint[=o]
gods into Buddhas elect, or Buddhas to come, or Buddhas in a former
state of existence, were tasks that might appall the most
prodigious intellect, and even strain the capacities of what one
might imagine to be the universal religion for all mankind.</p>
<p>Yet from such a task continental Buddhism had not shrunk before
and did not shrink then, nor indeed from it do the insular Japanese
sects shrink now. Indeed, Buddhism is quite ready to adopt, absorb
and swallow up Japanese Christianity. With all encompassing
tentacles, and with colossal powers of digestion and assimilation,
Northern Buddhism had drawn into itself a large part of the
Brahmanism out of which it originally sprang,<a id="footnotetag7-4"
name="footnotetag7-4"></a><a href="#footnote7-4"><sup>4</sup></a>
reversing the old myth of Chronos by swallowing its parents. It had
gathered in, pretty much all that was in the heavens above and the
earth beneath and the waters that were under the earth, in Nepal,
Tibet, China, and Korea. Thoroughly exercised and disciplined, it
was ready to devour and digest all that the imagination of Japan
had conceived.</p>
<p>We must remember that, at the opening of the ninth century, the
Buddhism rampant in China and indeed throughout Chinese Asia was
the Tantra system of Yoga-chara.<a id="footnotetag7-5" name=
"footnotetag7-5"></a><a href="#footnote7-5"><sup>5</sup></a> This
compound of polytheism and pantheism, with its sensuous paradise,
its goddess of mercy and its pantheon of every sort of worshipable
beings, was also equipped with a system of philosophy by which
Buddhism could be adapted to almost every yearning of human nature
in its lowest or its highest form, and by which things apparently
contradictory could be reconciled. Furthermore&mdash;and this is
not <span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id=
"page195"></a>{195}</span> the least important thing to consider
when the work to be done is for the ordinary man as an individual
and for the common people in the mass&mdash;it had also a
tremendous apparatus for touching the imagination and captivating
the fancy of the unthinking and the uneducated.</p>
<p>For example, consider the equipment of the Buddhist priests of
the ninth century in the matter of art alone. Shint[=o] knows next
to nothing of art,<a id="footnotetag7-6" name=
"footnotetag7-6"></a><a href="#footnote7-6"><sup>6</sup></a> and
indeed one might almost say that it knows little of civilization.
It is like ultra-Puritanic Protestantism and Iconoclasm. Buddhism,
on the contrary, is the mother of art, and art is her ever-busy
child and handmaid. The temples of the Kami were bald and bare. The
Kojiki told nothing of life hereafter, and kept silence on a
hundred points at which human curiosity is sure to be active, and
at which the Yoga system was voluble. Buddhism came with a set of
visible symbols which should attract the eye and fire the
imagination, and within ethical limits, the passions also. It was a
mixed and variegated system,&mdash;a resultant of many
forces.<a id="footnotetag7-7" name="footnotetag7-7"></a><a href=
"#footnote7-7"><sup>7</sup></a> It came with the thought of India,
the art-influence of Greece, the philosophy of Persia, the
speculations of the Gnostics and, in all probability, with ideas
borrowed indirectly from Nestorian or other forms of Christianity;
and thus furnished, it entered Japan.</p>
<h3>The Mission of Art.</h3>
<p>Thus far the insular kingdom had known only the monochrome
sketches of the Chinese painters, which could have a meaning for
the educated few alone. The composite Tantra dogmas fed the fancy
and stimulated <span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id=
"page196"></a>{196}</span> the imagination, filling them with
pictures of life, past, present and future. "The sketch was
replaced by the illumination." Whole schools of artists, imported
from China and Korea, multiplied their works and attracted the
untrained senses of the people, by filling the temples with a blaze
of glory. "This result was sought by a gorgeous but studied play of
gold and color, and a lavish richness of mounting and accessories,
that appear strangely at variance with the begging bowl and patched
garments of primitive Buddhism."<a id="footnotetag7-8" name=
"footnotetag7-8"></a><a href="#footnote7-8"><sup>8</sup></a> The
change in the Japanese temple was as though the gray clouds had
been kissed by the sun and made to laugh rainbows. The country of
the Fertile Plain of Sweet Flags was transformed. It suddenly
became the land wherein gods grew not singly but in whole forests.
Like the Shulamite, when introduced among the jewelled ladies of
Solomon's harem, so stood the boor amid the sheen and gold of the
new temples.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Gold was the one thing essential to the Buddhist altar-piece,
and sometimes, when applied on a black ground, was the only
material used. In all cases it was employed with an unsparing hand.
It appeared in uniform masses, as in the body of the Buddha or in
the golden lakes of the Western Paradise; in minute diapers upon
brocades and clothing, in circlets and undulating rays, to form the
glory surrounding the head of Amitaba; in raised bosses and rings
upon the armlets or necklets of the Bodhisattvas and Devas, and in
a hundred other manners. The pigments chosen to harmonize with this
display were necessarily body colors of the most pronounced lines,
and were untoned by any trace of chiaroscuro. Such materials as
these would surely try the average artist, but the Oriental painter
knew how to dispose them without risk of crudity or gaudiness, and
the precious metal, however lavishly applied, was distributed over
the picture with a judgment that would <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>{197}</span> make it
difficult to alter or remove any part without detriment to the
beauty of the work."<a id="footnotetag7-9" name=
"footnotetag7-9"></a><a href="#footnote7-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our day, Japanese art has won its own place in the world's
temple of beauty. Even those familiar with the master-pieces of
Europe do not hesitate to award to the artists of Nippon a meed of
praise which, within certain limits, is justly applied to them
equally with the masters of the Italian, the Dutch, the Flemish, or
the French schools. It serves our purpose simply to point out that
art was a powerful factor in the religious conquest of the Japanese
for the new doctrines of the Yoga system, which in Japan is called
Riy[=o]bu, or Mixed Buddhism.</p>
<p>We say Mixed Buddhism rather than Riy[=o]bu Shint[=o], for
Shint[=o] was less corrupted than swallowed up, while Buddhism
suffered one more degree of mixture and added one more chapter of
decay. It increased in its visible body, while in its mind it
became less and less the religion of Buddha and more and more a
thing with the old Shint[=o] heart still in it, making a strange
growth in the eyes of the continental believers. To the Northern
and Southern was now added an Eastern or Japanese Buddhism.</p>
<p>Who was the wonder-worker that annexed the Land of the Gods to
Buddhadom and re-read the Kojiki as a sutra, and all Japanese
history and traditions as only a chapter of the incarnations of
Buddha?</p>
<h3>K[=o]b[=o] the Wonder Worker.</h3>
<p>The Philo and Euhemerus of Japan was the priest Kukai, who was
born in the province of Sanuki, in the year 774. He is better known
by his posthumous title <span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id=
"page198"></a>{198}</span> K[=o]b[=o] Daishi, or the Great Teacher
who promulgates the Law. By this name we shall call him. About his
birth, life and death, have multiplied the usual swaddling bands of
Japanese legend and tradition,<a id="footnotetag7-10" name=
"footnotetag7-10"></a><a href="#footnote7-10"><sup>10</sup></a> and
to his tomb at the temple on Mount K[=o]-ya, the Campo Santo of
Japanese Buddhism, still gather innumerable pilgrims. The "hall of
ten thousand lamps," each flame emblematic of the Wisdom that
saves, is not, indeed, in these days lighted annually as of old;
but the vulgar yet believe that the great master still lives in his
mausoleum, in a state of profoundly silent meditation. Into the
hall of bones near by, covering a deep pit, the teeth and "Adam's
apple" of the cremated bodies of believers are thrown by their
relatives, though the pit is cleared out every three years. The
devotees believe that by thus disposing of the teeth and "Adam's
apple," they obtain the same spiritual privileges as if they were
actually entombed there, that is, of being born again into the
heaven of the Bodhisattva or the Pure Land of Absolute Bliss, by
virtue of the mystic formulas repeated by the great master in his
lifetime.</p>
<p>Let us sketch the life of K[=o]b[=o],</p>
<p>First named Toto-mono, or Treasure, by his parents, who sent him
to Ki[=o]t[=o] to be educated for the priesthood, the youth spent
four years in the study of the Chinese classics. Dissatisfied with
the teachings of Confucius, he became a disciple of a famous
Buddhist priest, named Iwabuchi (Rock-edge or throne). Soon taking
upon himself the vows of the monk, he was first named Kukai,
meaning "space and sea," or heaven and earth.<a id=
"footnotetag7-11" name="footnotetag7-11"></a><a href=
"#footnote7-11"><sup>11</sup></a> He overcame the dragons that
assaulted him, by prayers, by spitting at them the rays of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id=
"page199"></a>{199}</span> evening star which had flown from heaven
into his mouth and by repeating the mystic formulas called
Dharani.<a id="footnotetag7-12" name="footnotetag7-12"></a><a href=
"#footnote7-12"><sup>12</sup></a> Annoyed by hobgoblins with whom
he was obliged to converse, he got rid of them by surrounding
himself with a consecrated imaginary enclosure into which they were
unable to enter against his will.</p>
<p>We mention these legends only to call the attention to the fact
that they are but copies of those already accepted in China at that
time, and are the logical and natural fruit of the Tantra school at
which we have glanced. In 804, K[=o]b[=o] was appointed to visit
the Middle Kingdom as a government student. By means of his clever
pen and calligraphic skill he won his way into the Chinese capital.
He became the favored disciple of a priest who taught him the
mystic doctrines of the Yoga. Having acquired the whole of the
system, and equipped himself with a large library of Buddhist
doctrinal works and still more with every sort of ecclesiastical
furniture and religious goods, he returned to Japan.</p>
<p>Multitudes of wonders are reported about K[=o]b[=o], all of
which show the growth of the Tantra school. It is certain that his
erudition was immense, and that he was probably the most learned
man of Japan in that age, and possibly of any other age. Besides
being a Japanese Ezra in multiplying writings, he is credited with
the invention of the hira-gana, or running script, and if correctly
so, he deserves on this account alone an immortal honor equal to
that of Cadmus or Sequoia. The kana<a id="footnotetag7-13" name=
"footnotetag7-13"></a><a href="#footnote7-13"><sup>13</sup></a> is
a syllabary of forty-seven letters, which by diacritical marks, may
be increased to seventy. The kata-kana is the square or print form,
the hira-kana is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id=
"page200"></a>{200}</span> the round or "grass" character for
writing. Though not as valuable as a true phonetic alphabet, such
as the Koreans and the Cherokees possess, the <i>i-ro-ha</i>, or
kana script, even though a syllabary and not an alphabet, was a
wonderful aid to popular writing and instruction.</p>
<p>Evidently the idea of the i-ro-ha, or Japanese ABC, was derived
from the Sanskrit alphabet, or, what some modern Anglo-Indian has
called the Deva-Nagari or the god-alphabet. There is no evidence,
however, to show that K[=o]b[=o] did more than arrange in order
forty-seven of the easiest Chinese signs then used, in such a
manner that they conveyed in a few lines of doggerel the sense of a
passage from a sutra in which the mortality of man and the
emptiness of all things are taught, and the doctrine of Nirvana is
suggested.<a id="footnotetag7-14" name=
"footnotetag7-14"></a><a href="#footnote7-14"><sup>14</sup></a>
Hokusai, the artist, in a sketch which embodies the popular idea of
this bonze's immense industry, represents him copying the shastras
and sutras. K[=o]b[=o] is on a seat before a large upright sheet of
paper. He holds a brush-pen in his mouth, and one in each of his
hands and feet, all moving at once.<a id="footnotetag7-15" name=
"footnotetag7-15"></a><a href="#footnote7-15"><sup>15</sup></a>
Favorite portions of the Buddhist scriptures were indeed so rapidly
multiplied in Japan in the ninth century, as to suggest the idea,
that, even in this early age, block printing had been imported from
China, whence also afterward, in all probability, it was exported
into Europe before the days of Gutenberg and Coster.<a id=
"footnotetag7-16" name="footnotetag7-16"></a><a href=
"#footnote7-16"><sup>16</sup></a> The popular imagination, however,
was more easily moved on seeing five brushes kept at work and all
at once by the muscles in the fingers, toes and mouth of one man.
Yet, had his life lasted six hundred years instead of sixty, he
could hardly have graven all the images, scaled all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id=
"page201"></a>{201}</span> mountain peaks, confounded all the
sceptics, wrought all the miracles and performed all the other
feats with which he is popularly credited.<a id="footnotetag7-17"
name="footnotetag7-17"></a><a href=
"#footnote7-17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h3>K[=o]b[=o] Irenicon.</h3>
<p>K[=o]b[=o] indeed was both the Philo and Euhemerus of Japan,
plus a large amount of priestly cunning and what his enemies insist
was dishonesty and forgery. Soon after his return from China, he
went to the temples of Is&eacute;,<a id="footnotetag7-18" name=
"footnotetag7-18"></a><a href="#footnote7-18"><sup>18</sup></a> the
most holy place of Shint[=o].<a id="footnotetag7-19" name=
"footnotetag7-19"></a><a href="#footnote7-19"><sup>19</sup></a>
Taking a reverent attitude before the chief shrine, that of Toko
Uk&eacute; Bim&eacute; no Kami or Abundant-Food-Lady-God, or the
deified Earth as the producer of food and the upholder of all
things upon its surface, the suppliant waited patiently while
fasting and praying.</p>
<p>In this, K[=o]b[=o] did but follow out the ordinary Shint[=o]
plan for securing god-possession and obtaining revelation; that is,
by starving both the stomach and the brain.<a id="footnotetag7-20"
name="footnotetag7-20"></a><a href=
"#footnote7-20"><sup>20</sup></a> After a week's waiting he
obtained the vision. The Food-possessing Goddess revealed to him
the yoke (or Yoga) by which he could harness the native and the
imported gods to the chariot of victorious Buddhism. She manifested
herself to him and delivered the revelation on which his system is
founded, and which, briefly stated, is as follows:</p>
<p>All the Shint[=o] deities are avatars or incarnations of Buddha.
They were manifestations to the Japanese, before Gautama had become
the enlightened one, or the jewel in the lotus, and before the holy
wheel of the law or the sacred shastras and sutras had reached the
island empire. Further more, provision was made for the future gods
and deified holy ones, who were <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page202" id="page202"></a>{202}</span> to proceed from the loins
of the Mikado, or other Japanese fathers, according to the saying
of Buddha which is thus recorded in a Japanese popular work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Life has a limited span, and naught may avail to extend it.
This is manifested by the impermanence of human beings, but yet,
whenever necessary, I will hereafter make my appearance from time
to time as a god (Kami), a sage (Confucian teacher), or a Buddha
(Hotok&eacute;)."<a id="footnotetag7-21" name=
"footnotetag7-21"></a><a href="#footnote7-21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a word, the Shint[=o] goddess talked as orthodox (Yoga)
Buddhism as the ancient characters of the Indian, Persian and
pre-Islam-Arabic stories in the Arabian Nights now talk the purest
Mohammedanism.<a id="footnotetag7-22" name=
"footnotetag7-22"></a><a href="#footnote7-22"><sup>22</sup></a>
According to the words put into Gautama's mouth at the time of his
death, the Buddha was already to reappear in the particular form
and in all the forms, acceptable to Shint[=o]ists, Confucianists,
or Buddhists of whatever sect.</p>
<p>Descending from the shrine of vision and revelation, with a
complete scheme of reconciliation, with correlated catalogues of
Shint[=o] and Buddhist gods, with liturgies, with lists of old
popular festivals newly named, with the apparatus of art to
captivate the senses, K[=o]b[=o] forthwith baptized each native
Shint[=o] deity with a new Chinese-Buddhistic name. For every
Shint[=o] festival he arranged a corresponding Buddhist's saints'
day or gala time. Then, training up a band of disciples, he sent
them forth proclaiming the new irenicon.</p>
<h3>The Hindu Yoga Becomes Japanese Riy[=o]bu.</h3>
<p>It was just the time for this brilliant and able ecclesiastic to
succeed. The power and personal influence of the Mikado were
weakening, the court swarmed with <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page203" id="page203"></a>{203}</span> monks, the rising military
classes were already safely under the control of the shavelings,
and the pen of learning had everywhere proved itself mightier than
the sword and muscle. K[=o]b[=o]'s particular dialectic weapons
were those of the Yoga-chara, or in Japanese, the Shingon Shu, or
Sect of the True Word.<a id="footnotetag7-23" name=
"footnotetag7-23"></a><a href="#footnote7-23"><sup>23</sup></a> He,
like his Chinese master, taught that we can attain the state of the
Enlightened or Buddha, while in the present physical body which was
born of our parents.</p>
<p>This branch of Buddhism is said to have been founded in India
about A.D. 200, by a saint who made the discovery of an iron pagoda
inhabited by the holy one, Vagrasattva, who communicated the exact
doctrine to those who have handed it down through the Hindoo and
Chinese patriarchs. The books or scriptures of this sect are in
three sutras; yet the essential point in them is the Mandala or the
circle of the Two Parts, or in Japanese Riy[=o]bu. Introduced into
China, A.D. 720, it is known as the Yoga-chara school.</p>
<p>K[=o]b[=o] finding a Chinese worm, made a Japanese dragon, able
to swallow a national religion. In the act of deglutition and the
long process of the digestion of Shint[=o], Japanese Buddhism
became something different from every other form of the faith in
Asia. Noted above all previous developments of Buddhism for its
pantheistic tendencies, the Shingon sect could recognize in any
Shint[=o] god, demi-god, hero, or being, the avatar in a previous
stage of existence of some Buddhist being of corresponding
grade.</p>
<p>For example,<a id="footnotetag7-24" name=
"footnotetag7-24"></a><a href="#footnote7-24"><sup>24</sup></a>
Amat&eacute;ras[)u] or Ten-Sh[=o]-Dai-Jin, the sun-goddess, becomes
Dai Nichi Ni[=o]rai or Amida, whose colossal effigies stand in the
bronze images Dai Butsu at Nara, Ki[=o]to and Kamakura.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id=
"page204"></a>{204}</span> Ojin, the god of war, became Hachiman
Dai Bosatsu, or the great Bodhisattva of the Eight Banners. Adopted
as their patron by the fighting Genji or Minamoto warriors of
medi&aelig;val times, the Buddhists could not well afford to have
this popular deity outside their pantheon.</p>
<p>For each of the thirty days of the month, a Bodhisattva, or in
Japanese pronunciation Bosatsu, was appointed. Each of these
Bodhisattvas became a Dai Mi[=o] Jin or Great Enlightened Spirit,
and was represented as an avatar in Japan of Buddha in the previous
ages, when the Japanese were not yet prepared to receive the holy
law of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Where there were not enough Dai Mi[=o] Jin already existing in
native traditions to fill out the number required by the new
scheme, new titles were invented. One of these was Ten-jin,
Heavenly being or spirit. The famous statesman and scholar of the
tenth century, Sugawara Michizan&eacute;, was posthumously named
Tenjin, and is even to this day worshipped by many children of
Japan as he was formerly for a thousand years by nearly all of
them, as the divine patron of letters. Kompira, Benten and other
popular deities, often considered as properly belonging to
Shint[=o], "are evidently the offspring of Buddhist priestly
ingenuity."<a id="footnotetag7-25" name=
"footnotetag7-25"></a><a href="#footnote7-25"><sup>25</sup></a> Out
of the eight millions or so of native gods, several hundred were
catalogued under the general term Gon-gen, or temporary
manifestations of Buddha. In this list are to be found not only the
heroes of local tradition, but even deified forces of nature, such
as wind and fire. The custom of making gods of great men after
their death, thus begun on a large scale by K[=o]b[=o], has gone on
for centuries. Iy&eacute;yas[)u], the political unifier of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id=
"page205"></a>{205}</span> Japan, shines as a star of the first
magnitude in the heavens of the Riy[=o]bu system, under the mime of
T[=o]-sh[=o]-g[=u], or Great Light of the East. The common people
speak of him as Gon-gen Sama, the latter word being an honorary
form of address for all beings from a baby to a Bosatsu.</p>
<p>In this way, K[=o]b[=o] arranged a sort of clearing-house or
joint-stock company in which the Bodhisattvas, kami and other
miscellaneous beings, in either the native or foreign religion,
were mutually interchangeable. In a large sense, this feat of
priestly dexterity was but the repetition in history, of that of
Asanga with the Brahmanism and Buddhism of India three centuries
before. It was this Asanga who wrote the Yoga-chara Bhumi. The
succession of syncretists in India, China and Japan is Asanga,
Hiuki[=o] and K[=o]b[=o].</p>
<h3>The Happy Family of Riy[=o]bu.</h3>
<p>Nevertheless this attempt at making a happy family and ploughing
with an ox and ass in the same yoke, has not been an unqualified
success. It will sometimes happen that one god escapes the
classification made by the Buddhists and slips into the fold of
Shint[=o], or <i>vice versa</i>; while again the label-makers and
pasters&mdash;as numerous in scholastic Buddhism as in sectarian
Christendom&mdash;have hard work to make the labels stick. A
popular Gon-gen or Dai-Mi[=o]-jin, whose name and renown has for
centuries attracted crowds of pilgrims, and yielded fat revenues as
regularly as the autumn harvests, is not readily surrendered by the
old Buddhist proprietors, however cleverly or craftily the bonzes
may yield outward conformity to governmental edicts. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>{206}</span> On the
other hand, the efforts, both archaeological and practical, which
have been made in recent years by fiercely zealous Shint[=o]ists,
savor of the smartness of New Japan more than they suggest either
sincerity or edification. It often requires the finest tact on the
part of both the strenuous Buddhists and the stalwart purists of
Shint[=o], to extricate the various gods out of the mixture and
mess of Riy[=o]bu Shint[=o], and to keep them from jostling each
other.</p>
<p>This reclaiming and kidnapping of gods and transferring them
from one camp to another, has been especially active since 1870,
when, under government auspices, the Riy[=o]bu temples were purged
of all Buddhist idols, furniture and influences. The term Dai
Mi[=o] Jin, or Great Illustrious Spirit, is no longer officially
permitted to be used of the old kami or gods of Shint[=o], who were
known to have existed before the days of K[=o]b[=o]. In some cases
these gods have lost much of the esteem in which they were held for
centuries. Especially is this true of the infamous rebel of the
tenth century, Masakado.<a id="footnotetag7-26" name=
"footnotetag7-26"></a><a href="#footnote7-26"><sup>26</sup></a> On
the entrance into Yedo of the Imperial army, in 1868, his idol was
torn from its shrine and hacked to pieces by the patriots. His
place as a deity (Kanda Dai Mi[=o] Jin, or Great Illustrious Spirit
of Kanda) was taken by another deified being, a brother to the
aboriginal earth-god who, in the ages of the Kami, "resigned his
throne in favor of the Mikado's ancestors when they descended from
Heaven." The apotheosis of the rebel Masakado had been resorted to
by the Buddhist canonizers because the unquiet spirit of the dead
man troubled the people. This method of laying a ghost by making a
god of him, was for centuries a favorite <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>{207}</span> one in
Japanese Buddhism. Indeed, a large part of the practical and
parochial duties of the bonzes consists in quieting the restless
spirits of the departed.</p>
<p>All Japanese popular religion of the past has been intensely
local and patriotic. The ancient idea that Nippon was the first
country created and the centre of the world, has persisted through
the ages, modifying every imported religion. Hence the noticeable
fact in Japanese Buddhism, of the comparative degradation of the
Hindu deities and the exaltation of those which were native to the
soil.</p>
<p>The normal Japanese, be he priest or lay brother, theologian or
statesman, is nothing if not patriotic. Even the Chinese gods and
goddesses which, clothed in Indian drapery and still preserving
their Aryan features, were imported to Japan, could not hold their
own in competition with the popularity of the indigenous
inhabitants of the Japanese pantheon. The normal Japanese eye does
not see the ideals of beauty in the human face and form in common
with the Aryan vision. Benten or Knanon, with the features and
drapery of the homelike beauties of Yamato or Adzuma, have ever
been more lovely to the admiring eye of the Japanese sailor and
farmer, than the Aryan features of the idols imported from India.
So also, the worshipper to whom the lovely scenery of Japan was
fresh from the hands of the kami who were so much like himself,
turned naturally in preference, to the "gods many" of his own
land.</p>
<p>Succeeding centuries only made it worse for the imported devas
or gods, while the kami, or the gods sprung from the soil created
by Izanami and Izanagi steadily rose in honor.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id=
"page208"></a>{208}</span>
<h3>Degradation of the Foreign Deities.</h3>
<p>For example, the Indian saint Dharma is reputed to have come to
the Dragon-fly Country long before the advent of Buddhism, but the
people were not ready for him or his teachings, and therefore he
returned to India. So at least declares the book entitled San Kai
Ri<a id="footnotetag7-27" name="footnotetag7-27"></a><a href=
"#footnote7-27"><sup>27</sup></a> (Mountain, Sea and Earth), which
is a re-reading and explanation of Japanese mythology and tradition
as recorded in the Kojiki, by a Ki[=o]t[=o] priest of the Shin Shu
Sect. Of this Dharma, it is said, that he outdid the Roman Regulus
who suffered involuntary loss of his eyelids at the hands of the
Carthaginians. Dharma cut off his own eyelids, because he could not
keep awake.<a id="footnotetag7-28" name=
"footnotetag7-28"></a><a href="#footnote7-28"><sup>28</sup></a>
Throwing the offending flesh upon the ground, he saw the tea-plant
arise to help holy men to keep vigil. Daruma, as the Japanese spell
his name, has a temple in central Japan. It is related that when
Sh[=o]toku, the first patron of Buddhism, was one day walking
abroad he found a poor man dying of hunger, who refused to answer
any questions or give his name. Sh[=o]toku ordered food to be given
him, and wrapped his own mantle round him. Next day the beggar
died, and the prince charitably had him buried on the spot. Shortly
afterward it was observed that the mantle was lying neatly folded
up, on the tomb, which on examination proved to be empty. The
supposed dying beggar was no other than the Indian Saint Dharma,
and a pagoda was built over the grave, in which images of the
priest and saint were enshrined.<a id="footnotetag7-29" name=
"footnotetag7-29"></a><a href="#footnote7-29"><sup>29</sup></a>
Yet, alas, to-day Daruma the Hindoo and foreigner, despite his
avatar, his humility, his vigils and his self-mutilation, has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id=
"page209"></a>{209}</span> been degraded to be the shop-sign of the
tobacconists. Besides being ruthlessly caricatured, he is usually
pictured with a scowl, his lidless eyes as wide open as those upon
a Chinese junk-prow or an Egyptian coffin-lid. Often even, he has a
pipe in his mouth&mdash;a comical anachronism, suggestive to the
smoker of the dark ages that knew no tobacco, before nicotine made
the whole world of savage and of civilized kin. Legless dolls and
snow-men are named after this foreigner, whose name is associated
almost entirely with what is ludicrous.</p>
<p>On K[=o]b[=o]'s expounding his scheme to the Mikado, the emperor
was so pleased with his servant's ingenuity, that he gave it the
name of Riy[=o]bu<a id="footnotetag7-30" name=
"footnotetag7-30"></a><a href="#footnote7-30"><sup>30</sup></a>
Shint[=o]; that is, the two-fold divine doctrine, double way of the
gods, or amalgamated theology. Henceforth the Japanese could enter
Nirvana or Paradise through a two-leaved gate. As for the people,
they also were pleased, as they usually are when change or reform
does not mean abolition of the old festivals, or of the washings,
sousings, and fun at the tombs of their ancestors in the
graveyards, or the merry-makings, or the pilgrimages,<a id=
"footnotetag7-31" name="footnotetag7-31"></a><a href=
"#footnote7-31"><sup>31</sup></a> which are usually only other
names for social recreation, and often for sensual debauch. The
Yoga had become a <i>kubiki</i>, for Shint[=o] and Buddhism were
now harnessed together, not indeed as true yoke-fellows, but yet
joined as inseparably as two oxen making the same furrow.</p>
<p>Many a miya now became a tera. At first in many edifices, the
rites of Shint[=o] and Buddhism were alternately performed. The
Buddhist symbols might be in the front, and the Shint[=o]ist in the
rear of the sacred hall, or <i>vice versa</i>, with a bamboo
curtain between; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id=
"page210"></a>{210}</span> but gradually the two blended. Instead
of austere simplicity, the Shint[=o] interior contained a museum of
idols.</p>
<p>Image carvers had now plenty to do in making, out of camphor or
<i>hinoki</i> wood, effigies of such of the eight million or so of
kamis as were given places in the new and enlarged pantheon. The
multiplication was always on the side of Buddhism. Soon, also, the
architecture was altered from the type of the primitive hut, to
that of the low Chinese temple with great sweeping roof, re-curved
eaves, many-columned auditorium and imposing gateway, with lacquer,
paint, gilding and ceilings, on which, in blazing gold and color,
were depicted the emblems of the Buddhist paradise. Many of these
still remain even after the national purgation of 1870, just as the
Christian inscriptions survive in the marble palimpsests of
Mahometan mosques, converted from basilicas, at Damascus or
Constantinople. The torii was no longer raised in plain hinoki
wood, but was now constructed of hewn stone, rounded or polished.
Sometimes it was even of bronze with gilded crests and Sanskrit
monograms, surmounted, it may be, with tablets of painted or
stained wood, on which were Chinese letters glittering with gold.
This departure from the primitive idea of using only the natural
trunks of trees, "somewhat on the principle of Exodus,
20:25,"<a id="footnotetag7-32" name="footnotetag7-32"></a><a href=
"#footnote7-32"><sup>32</sup></a> was a radical one in the ninth
century. The elongated barrels with iron hoops, or the riveted
boiler-plate and stove-pipe pattern, in this era of Meiji is a
still more radical and even scandalous innovation.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id=
"page211"></a>{211}</span>
<h3>Shint[=o] Buried in Buddhism.</h3>
<p>So complete was the victory of Riy[=o]buism, that for nearly a
thousand years Shint[=o] as a religion, except in a few isolated
spots, ceased from sight and sank to a mere mythology or to the
shadow of a mythology. The very knowledge even of the ancient
traditions was lost in the Buddhaized forms in which the old
stories<a id="footnotetag7-33" name="footnotetag7-33"></a><a href=
"#footnote7-33"><sup>33</sup></a> were cast, or in the omnipresent
ritual of the Buddhist tera.</p>
<p>Yet, after all, it is a question as to which suffered most,
Buddhism or Shint[=o]. Who can tell which was the base and which
was the true metal in the alloy that was formed? The San Kai Ri
shows how superstitious manifold became imbedded in Buddhism. It
was not alone through the Shingon sect, which K[=o]b[=o]
introduced, that this Yoga or union came. In the other great sect
called the Tendai, and in the later sects, more especially in that
of Nichiren, the same principle of absorption was followed. These
sects also adopted many elements derived from the god-way and thus
became Shint[=o]ized. Indeed, it seems certain that that vast
development of Japanese Buddhism, peculiar to Japan and unknown to
the rest of the Buddhist world, scouted by the Southern Buddhists
as dreadful heresy, and rousing the indignation of students of
early Buddhism, like Max M&uuml;ller and Professor Whitney, is
largely owing to this attempted digestion of Japanese mythology.
The anaconda may indeed be able, by reason of its marvellously
flexible jaws and its abundant activity of salivary glands, to
swallow the calf, and even the ox; but sometimes the serpent is
killed by its own <span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id=
"page212"></a>{212}</span> voracity, or at least made helpless
before the destroying hunter. When sweet potatoes and pumpkins are
planted in the same hill, and the cooked product comes on the
table, it is hard to tell whether it is tuber or hollow fruit,
subterranean or superficial growth, that we are eating. So in
Riy[=o]bu, whether it be most <i>imo</i> or <i>kabocha</i> is a
fair question. If the Buddhism in Japan did but add a chapter of
decay and degradation to the religion of the Light of Asia, is not
this owing to the act of K[=o]b[=o]&mdash;justified indeed by those
who imitated his example, yet hardly to be called honest? A stroke
of ecclesiastical dexterity, it may have been, but scarcely a
lawful example or an illustrious and commendable specimen of
syncretism in religion.</p>
<p>Many students have asked what is the peculiar, the
characteristic difference between the Buddhism of Japan and the
other Buddhisms of the Asian continent. If there be one cause,
leading all others, we incline to believe it is because Japanese
Buddhism is not the Buddhism of Gautama, but is so largely
Riy[=o]bu or Mixed. Yet in the alloy, which ingredient has
preserved most of its qualities? Is Japanese Buddhism really
Shint[=o]ized Buddhism, or Buddhaized Shint[=o]? Which is the
parasite and which the parasitized? Is the hermit crab Shint[=o],
and the shell Buddhism, or <i>vice versa</i>? About as many corrupt
elements from Shint[=o] entered into the various Buddhist sects as
Buddhism gave to Shint[=o].</p>
<p>This process of Shint[=o]izing Buddhism or of Buddhaizing
Shint[=o]&mdash;that is, of combining Shint[=o] or purely Japanese
ideas and practices with the systems imported from India, went on
for five centuries. The old native habits and mental
characteristics were not <span class="pagenum"><a name="page213"
id="page213"></a>{213}</span> eradicated or profoundly modified;
they were rather safely preserved in so-called Buddhism, not indeed
as dead flies in amber but as live creatures, fattening on a body,
which, every year, while keeping outward form and name, was being
emptied of its normal and typical life. It is no gain to pure water
to add either microbes or the food which nourishes them.</p>
<h3>Buddhism Writes New Chapters of Decay.</h3>
<p>Phenomenally, the victory was that of Buddhism. The mustard-seed
has indeed become a great tree, lodging every fowl of heaven, clean
and unclean; but potentially and in reality, the leavening power,
as now seen, seems to have been that of Shint[=o]. Or, to change
metaphor, since the hermit crab and the shell were separated by law
only one generation ago, in 1870, we shall soon, before many
generations, discern clearly which has the life and which has only
the shell.<a id="footnotetag7-34" name=
"footnotetag7-34"></a><a href="#footnote7-34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>There are but few literary monuments<a id="footnotetag7-35"
name="footnotetag7-35"></a><a href=
"#footnote7-35"><sup>35</sup></a> of Riy[=o]buism, and it has left
few or no marks in the native chronicles, misnamed history, which
utterly omit or ignore so many things interesting to the student
and humanist.<a id="footnotetag7-36" name=
"footnotetag7-36"></a><a href="#footnote7-36"><sup>36</sup></a> Yet
to this mixture or amalgamation of Buddhism with Shint[=o], more
probably than to any other direct influence, may also be ascribed
that striking alteration in the system of Chinese ethics or
Confucianism which differentiates the Japanese form from that
prevalent in China. That is, instead of filial piety, the relation
of parent and child, occupying the first place, loyalty, the
relation of lord and retainer, master and servant, became supreme.
Although Buddhism made the Mikado first a King (Tenn[=o]) or Son of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id=
"page214"></a>{214}</span> Heaven (Ten-Shi), and then a monk
(H[=o]-[=o]), and after his death a Hotok&eacute; or Buddhist
deity, it caused him early to abdicate from actual life. Buddhism
is thus directly responsible for the habitual Japanese resignation
from active life almost as soon as it is entered, by men in all
classes. Buddhism started all along and down through the lines of
Japanese society the idea of early retirement from duty; so that
men were considered old at forty, and <i>hors concours</i> before
forty-five.<a id="footnotetag7-37" name=
"footnotetag7-37"></a><a href="#footnote7-37"><sup>37</sup></a>
Life was condemned as vanity of vanities before it was mature, and
old age a friend that nobody wished to meet,<a id="footnotetag7-38"
name="footnotetag7-38"></a><a href=
"#footnote7-38"><sup>38</sup></a> although Japanese old age is but
European prime. In a measure, Buddhism is thus responsible for the
paralysis of Japanese civilization, which, like oft-tapped
maple-trees, began to die at the top. This was in accordance with
its theories and its literature. In the Bible there is, possibly,
one book which is pessimistic in tone, Ecclesiastes. In the bulky
and dropsical canon of Buddhism there is a whole library of
despondency and despair.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the ethical element held its own in the Japanese
mind; and against the pessimism and puerility of Buddhism and the
religious emptiness of Shint[=o], the bond of Japanese society was
sought in the idea of loyalty. While then, as we repeat, everything
that comes to the Japanese mind suffers as it were "a sea change,
into something new and strange," is it not fair to say that the
change made by K[=o]b[=o] was at the expense of Buddhism as a
system, and that the thing that suffered reversion was the exotic
rather than the native plant? For, in the emergence of this new
idea of loyalty as supreme, Shint[=o] and not Buddhism was the
dictator.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id=
"page215"></a>{215}</span>
<p>Even more after K[=o]b[=o]'s death than during his life, Japan
improved upon her imported faith, and rapidly developed new sects
of all degrees of reputableness and disreputableness. Had
K[=o]b[=o] lived on through the centuries, as the boors still
believe;<a id="footnotetag7-39" name="footnotetag7-39"></a><a href=
"#footnote7-39"><sup>39</sup></a> he could not have stopped, had he
so desired, the workings of the leaven he had brought from China.
From the sixth to the twelfth century, was the missionary age of
Japanese Buddhism. Then followed two centuries of amazing
development of doctrine. Novelties in religion blossomed, fruited
and became monuments as permanent as the age-enduring forests
Hakon&eacute;, or Nikk[=o]. Gautama himself, were he to return to
"red earth" again, could not recognize his own cult in Japan.</p>
<p>In China to-day Buddhism is in a bad state. One writer calls it,
"The emasculated descendant that now occupies the land with its
drone of priests and its temples, in which scarce a worthy disciple
of the learned patriarchs of ancient days is to be found. Received
with open arms, persecuted, patronized, smiled upon, tolerated, it
with the last phase of its existence, has reached, not the halcyon
days of peace and rest, but its final stage, foreshadowing its
decay from rottenness and corruption."<a id="footnotetag7-40" name=
"footnotetag7-40"></a><a href="#footnote7-40"><sup>40</sup></a> So
also, in a like report, agree many witnesses. The common people of
China are to-day Taoists rather than Buddhists.<a id=
"footnotetag7-41" name="footnotetag7-41"></a><a href=
"#footnote7-41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>If this be the position in China, something not very far from it
is found in Japan to-day. Whatever may be the Buddhism of the few
learned scholars, who have imbibed the critical and scientific
spirit of Christendom, and whatever be the professions and
representations of its earnest adherents and partisans, it is
certain that popular Buddhism is both ethically and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>{216}</span> vitally
in a low state. In outward array the system is still imposing.
There are yet, it may be, millions of stone statues and whole
forests of wayside effigies, outdoors and
unroofed&mdash;irreverently called by the Japanese themselves, "wet
gods." Hosts upon hosts of lacquered and gilded images in wood,
sheltered under the temple tiles or shingles, still attract
worshippers. Despite shiploads of copper Buddhas exported as old
metal to Europe and America, and thousands of tons of gods and imps
melted into coin or cannon, there are myriads of metal reminders of
those fruits of a religion that once educated and satisfied; but
these are, in the main, no longer to the natives instruments of
inspiration or compellers to enthusiasm. In this time of practical
charity, they are poor substitutes for those hospitals and orphan
asylums which were practically unknown in Japan until the advent of
Christianity.</p>
<p>K[=o]b[=o]'s smart example has been followed only too well by
the people in every part of the country. One has but to read the
stacks of books of local history to see what an amazing proportion
of legends, ideas, superstitions and revelations rests on dreams;
how incredibly numerous are the apparitions; how often the floating
images of Buddha are found on the water; how frequently flowers
have rained out of the sky; how many times the idols have spoken or
shot forth their dazzling rays&mdash;in a word; how often art and
artifices have become alleged and accepted reality. Unfortunately,
the characteristics of this literature and undergrowth of idol lore
are monotony and lack of originality; for nearly all are copies of
K[=o]b[=o]'s model. His cartoon has been constantly before the busy
weavers of legend.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id=
"page217"></a>{217}</span>
<p>It may indeed be said, and said truly, that in its
multiplication of sects and in its growth of legend and
superstition, Buddhism has but followed every known religion,
including traditional Christianity itself. Yet popular Buddhism has
reached a point which shows, that, instead of having a
self-purgative and self-reforming power, it is apparently still
treading in the steps of the degradation which K[=o]b[=o]began.</p>
<h3>The Seven Gods of Good Fortune.</h3>
<p>We repeat it, Riy[=o]bu Buddhism is Japanese Buddhism with
vengeance. It is to-day suffering from the effect of its own sins.
Its <i>ingwa</i> is manifest. Take, for example, the little group
of divinities known as the Seven Gods of Good Fortune, which forms
a popular appendage to Japanese Buddhism and which are a direct and
logical growth of the work done by K[=o]b[=o], as shown in his
Riy[=o]bu system. Not from foreign writers and their fancies, nor
even from the books which profess to describe these divinities, do
we get such an idea of their real meaning and of their influence
with the people, as we do by observation of every-day practice, and
a study of the idols themselves and of Japanese folk-lore, popular
romance, local history and guidebooks. Those familiar divinities,
indeed, at the present day owe their vitality rather to the artists
than to priests, and, it may be, have received, together with some
rather rude handling, nearly the whole of their extended popularity
and influence from their lay supporters. The Seven Happy Gods of
Fortune form nominally a Buddhist assemblage, and their effigies on
the kami-dana or god-shelf, found in nearly every Japanese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id=
"page218"></a>{218}</span> house, are universally visible. The
child in Japan is rocked to sleep by the soothing sound of the
lullaby, which is often a prayer to these gods. Even though it may
be with laughing and merriment, that, in their name the evil gods
and imps are exorcised annually on New Year's eve, with showers of
beans which are supposed to be as disagreeable to the Buddhist
demons "as drops of holy water to the Devil," yet few households
are complete without one or more of the images or the pictures of
these favorite deities.</p>
<p>The separate elements of this conglomerate, so typical of
Japanese religion, are from no fewer than four different sources:
Brahmanism, Buddhism, Taoism and Shint[=o]ism. "Thus, Bishamon is
the Buddhist <i>V&acirc;is'ramana</i><a id="footnotetag7-42" name=
"footnotetag7-42"></a><a href="#footnote7-42"><sup>42</sup></a> and
the Brahmanic Kuvera; Benten is Sarasvat&icirc;, the wife of
Brahm&acirc;; Daikoku is an extremely popularised form of Mahakala,
the black-faced Temple Guardian; Hot&eacute;i has Taoist
attributes, but is regarded as an incarnation of
M&agrave;itrey&acirc;, the Buddhist Messiah; Fuku-roku-jiu is of
purely Taoist origin, and is perhaps a personification of Lao-Tsze
himself; Ju-r&oacute;-jin is almost certainly a duplicate of
Fuku-roku-jiu; and, lastly, Ebisu, as the son of Izanagi and
Izanami, is a contribution from the Shint[=o] hero-worship."<a id=
"footnotetag7-43" name="footnotetag7-43"></a><a href=
"#footnote7-43"><sup>43</sup></a> If Riy[=o]bu Buddhism be
two-fold, here is a texture or amalgam that is <i>shi-bu</i>,
four-fold. Let us watch lest <i>go-bu</i>, with Christianity mixed
in, be the next result of the process. To play the Japanese game of
go-ban, with Christianity as the fifth counter, and Jesus as a
Palestinian avatar of some Dhyani Buddha, crafty priests in Japan
are even now planning.</p>
<p>This illustration of the Seven Gods of Happiness, whose local
characters, functions and relations have <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>{219}</span> been
developed especially within the last three or four hundred years,
is but one of many that could be adduced, showing what proceeded on
a larger scale. The Riy[=o]bu process made it almost impossible for
the average native to draw the line between history and mythology.
It destroyed the boundary lines, as Pantheism invariably does,
between fact and fiction, truth and falsehood. The Japanese mind,
by a natural, possibly by a racial, tendency, falls easily into
Pantheism, which may be called the destroyer of boundaries and the
maker of chaos and ooze. Pretty much all early Japanese "history"
is ooze; yet there are grave and learned men, even in the
Constitutional Japan of the M&eacute;iji era&mdash;masters in their
arts and professions, graduates of technical and philosophical
courses&mdash;who solemnly talk about their "first emperor
ascending the throne, B.C. 660," and to whom the dragon-born, early
Mikados, and their fellow-tribesmen, seen through the exaggerated
mists of the Kojiki, are divine personages.</p>
<h3>The Gon-gen in the Processions.</h3>
<p>While living in Japan between 1870 and 1874, the writer used to
enjoy watching and studying the long processions which celebrated
the foundation of temples, national or local festivals, or the
completion of some great public enterprise, such as the railway
between T[=o]kio and Yokohama. In rich costume, decoration, and
representation most of the cultus-objects were marvels of art and
skill. Besides the gala dresses and uniforms, the fantastic
decorations and personal adornments, the dances which represented
the comedies and tragedies of the gods and the striking scenes in
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id=
"page220"></a>{220}</span> Kojiki, there wore colossal images of
Kami, Bodhisattvas, Gon-gen, Dai Mi[=o] Jin, and of imps, oni,
mythical animal forms and imaginary monsters.<a id=
"footnotetag7-44" name="footnotetag7-44"></a><a href=
"#footnote7-44"><sup>44</sup></a> More interesting than anything
else, however, were the male and female figures, set high upon
triumphal cars having many tiers, and arrayed in characteristic
primeval, ancient, medieval, or early modern dress. Some were of
scowling, others of benign visage. In some years, everyone of the
eight hundred and eight streets of Yedo sent its contribution of
men, money, decorations, or vehicles.</p>
<p>As seen by four kinds of spectators, the average ignorant
native, the Shint[=o]ist, the learned Buddhist, and the critical
historical scholar, these effigies represented three different
characters or creations. Especially were those divine personages
called Gon-gen worth the study of the foreign observer.</p>
<p>(1) The common boor or streetman saluted, for example, this or
that Dai Mi[=o] Jin, as the great illustrious spirit or god of its
particular district. To this spirit and image he prayed; in his
honor he made offerings; his wrath he feared; and his smile he
hoped to win, for the Gon-gen was a divine being.</p>
<p>(2) To the Shint[=o]ist, who hated Buddhism and the Riy[=o]bu
Shint[=o] which had overlaid his ancestral faith, and who scorned
and tabooed this Chinese term Dai Mi[=o] Jin, this or that image
represented a divine ancestor whose name had in it many Japanese
syllables, with no defiling Chinese sounds, and who was the Kami or
patron deity of this or that neighborhood.</p>
<p>(3) To the Buddhist, this or that personage, in his lifetime, in
the early ages of Japanese history, had been an avatar of Buddha
who had appeared in human <span class="pagenum"><a name="page221"
id="page221"></a>{221}</span> flesh and brought blessings to the
people and neighborhood; yet the people of the early ages being
unprepared to receive his doctrine or revelation, he had not then
revealed or preached it; but now, as for a thousand years since the
time of the illustrious and saintly K[=o]b[=o], he had his right
name and received his just honors and worship as an avatar of the
eternal Buddha. So, although Buddhist and Shint[=o]ist might
quarrel as to his title, and divide, even to anger, on minor
points, they would both agree in letting the common people take
their pleasure, enjoy the festivals and merriment, and preserve
their reverence and worship.</p>
<p>(4) Still another spectator studied with critical interest the
swaying figure high in air. With a taste for archaeology, he
admired the accuracy of the drapery and associations. He was
amused, it may be, with occasional anachronisms as to garments or
equipments. He knew that the original of this personage had been
nothing more than a human being, who might indeed have been
conspicuous as a brave soldier in war, or as a skilful physician
who helped to stop the plague, or as a civilizer who imported new
food or improved agriculture.</p>
<p>In a word, had this subject of the ancient Mikado lived in
modern Christendom, he might be honored through the government,
patent office, privy council, the admiralty, the university, or the
academy, as the case or worth might be. He might shine in a plastic
representation by the sculptor or artist, or be known in the
popular literature; but he would never receive religious worship,
or aught beyond honor and praise. In this swamping of history in
legend and of fact in dogma, we behold the fruit of K[=o]b[=o]'s
work, Riy[=o]bu Buddhism.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id=
"page222"></a>{222}</span>
<h3>K[=o]b[=o]'s Work Undone.</h3>
<p>Buddhism calls itself the jewel in the lotus. Japanese poetry
asks of the dewdrop "why, having the heart of the lotus for its
home, does it pretend to be a gem?" For a thousand years Riy[=o]bu
Buddhism was received as a pure brilliant of the first water, and
then the scholarship of the Shint[=o] revivalists of the eighteenth
century exposed the fraudulent nature of the unrelated parts and
declared that the jewel called Riy[=o]bu was but a craftsman's
doublet and should be split apart. Only a splinter of diamond, they
declared, crowned a mass of paste. Indignation made learning hot,
and in 1870 the cement was liquefied in civil war. The doublet was
rent asunder by imperial decree, as when a lapidist melts the
mastic that holds in deception adamant and glass, while real
diamond stands all fire short of the hydro-oxygen flame. The
Riy[=o]bu temples were purged of all Buddhist symbols, furniture,
equipment and personnel, and were made again to assume their august
and austere simplicity. In the eyes of the purely aesthetic critic,
this national purgation was Puritanical iconoclasm; in those of the
priests, cast out to earn rice elsewise and elsewhere, it was
outrage, which in individual instances called for reprisal in
blood, fire and assassination; to the Shint[=o]ist, it was an
exhibition of the righteous judgment of the long-insulted gods; in
the ken of the critical student, it seems very much like historic
and poetic justice.</p>
<p>In our day and time, Riy[=o]bu Buddhism furnishes us with a
warning, for, looked at from a purely human point of view, what
happened to Shint[=o] may possibly <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page223" id="page223"></a>{223}</span> happen to Japanese
Christianity. The successors of those who, in the ninth century,
did not scruple to Buddhaize Shint[=o], and in later times, even
our own, to Shint[=o]ize Buddhism while holding to Buddha's name
and all the revenue possible, will Buddhaize Christianity if they
have power and opportunity; and signs are not wanting to show that
this is upon their programme.</p>
<p>The water of stagnant Buddhism is still a swarming mass, which
needs cleansing to purity by a knowledge of one God who is Light
and Love. Without such knowledge, the manifold changes in Buddhism
will but form fresh chapters of degradation and decay. Holding such
knowledge, Christianity may pass through endless changes, for this
is her capability by Divine power and the authorization of her
Founder. The now Buddhism of our day is endeavoring to save itself
through reformation and progress. In doing so, the danger of the
destruction of the system is great, for thus far change has meant
decay.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII - NORTHERN BUDDHISM IN ITS DOCTRINAL
EVOLUTIONS</h2>
<h3>Chronological Outline.</h3>
<p>In sketching the history of the doctrinal developments of
Buddhism in Japan, we note that the system, greatly corrupted from
its original simplicity, was in 552 A.D. already a millennium old.
Several distinct phases of the much-altered faith of Gautama, were
introduced into the islands at various times between the sixth and
the ninth century. From these and from others of native origin have
sprung the larger Japanese sects. Even as late as the seventeenth
century, novelties in Buddhism were imported from China, and the
exotics took root in Japanese soil; but then, with a single
exception, only to grow as curiosities in the garden, rather than
as the great forests, which had already sprung from imported and
native specimens.</p>
<p>We may divide the period of the doctrinal development of
Buddhism in Japan into four epochs:</p>
<p>I. The first, from 552 to 805 A.D., will cover the first six
sects, which had for their centre of propagation, Nara, the
southern capital.</p>
<p>II. Then follows Riy[=o]bu Buddhism, from the ninth to the
twelfth centuries.</p>
<p>III. This was succeeded by another explosion of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>{228}</span> doctrine
wholly and peculiarly Japanese, and by a wide missionary
propagation.</p>
<p>IV. From the sixteenth to the nineteenth century, there is
little that is doctrinally noticeable, until our own time, when the
new Buddhism of to-day claims at least a passing notice.</p>
<p>The Japanese writers of ecclesiastical history classify in three
groups the twelve great sects as the first six, the two
medi&aelig;val, and the four modern sects.</p>
<p>In this lecture we shall merely summarize the characteristics of
the first five sects which existed before the opening of the ninth
century but which are not formally extant at the present time, and
treat more fully the purely Japanese developments. The first three
sects may be grouped under the head of the Hinayana, or Smaller
Vehicle, as Southern or primitive orthodox Buddhism is usually
called.</p>
<p>Most of the early sects, as will be seen, were founded upon some
particular sutra, or upon selections or collections of sutras. They
correspond to some extent with the manifold sects of Christendom,
and yet this illustration or reference must not be misleading. It
is not as though a new Christian sect, for example, were in A.D.
500 to be formed wholly on the gospel of Luke, or the book of the
Revelation; nor as though a new sect should now arise in Norway or
Tennessee because of a special emphasis laid on a combination of
the epistle to the Corinthians and the book of Daniel. It is rather
as though distinct names and organizations should be founded upon
the writings of Tertullian, of Augustine, of Luther, or of Calvin,
and that such sects should accept the literary work of these
scholars not only as commentaries but as Holy Scripture itself.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id=
"page229"></a>{229}</span>
<p>The Buddhist body of scriptures has several times been imported
and printed in Japan, but has never been translated into the
vernacular. The canon<a id="footnotetag8-1" name=
"footnotetag8-1"></a><a href="#footnote8-1"><sup>1</sup></a> is not
made up simply of writings purporting to be the words of Buddha or
of the apostles who were his immediate companions or followers. On
the contrary, the canon, as received in Japan, is made up of books,
written for the most part many centuries after the last of the
contemporaries of Gautama had passed away. Not a few of these
writings are the products of the Chinese intellect. Some books held
by particular sects as holy scripture were composed in Japan
itself, the very books themselves being worshipped. Nevertheless
those who are apparently farthest away from primitive Buddhism,
claim to understand Buddha most clearly.</p>
<h3>The Standard Doctrinal Work.</h3>
<p>One of the most famous of books, honored especially by several
of the later and larger sects in Japan, and probably the most
widely read and most generally studied book of the canon, is the
Saddharma Pundarika.<a id="footnotetag8-2" name=
"footnotetag8-2"></a><a href="#footnote8-2"><sup>2</sup></a>
Professor Kern, who has translated this very rhetorical work into
English, thinks it existed at or some time before 250 A.D., and
that in its most ancient form it dates some centuries earlier,
possibly as early as the opening of the Christian era. It has now
twenty-seven chapters, and may be called the typical scripture of
Northern Buddhism. It is overflowingly full of those sensuous
images and descriptions of the Paradise, in which the imagination
of the Japanese Buddhist so revels, and in it both rhetoric and
mathematics run wild. Of this book, "the cream of the revealed
doctrine," <span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id=
"page230"></a>{230}</span> we shall hear often again. It is the
standard of orthodoxy in Japanese Buddhism, the real genius of
which is monastic asceticism in morals and philosophical scepticism
in religion.</p>
<p>In most of the other sutras the burden of thought is ontology.
Doctrinally, Buddhism seems to be less a religion than a system of
philosophy. Hundreds of volumes in the canon concern themselves
almost wholly with ontological speculations. The Japanese
mind,<a id="footnotetag8-3" name="footnotetag8-3"></a><a href=
"#footnote8-3"><sup>3</sup></a> as described by those who have
studied most acutely and profoundly its manifestations in language
and literature, is essentially averse to speculation. Yet the first
forms of Buddhism presented to the Japanese, were highly
metaphysical. The history of thought in Japan, shows that these
abstractions of dogma were not congenial to the islanders. The new
faith won its way among the people by its outward sensuous
attractions, and by appeals to the imagination, the fancy and the
emotions; though the men of culture were led captive by reasoning
which they could not answer, even if they could comprehend it.
Though these early forms of dogma and philosophy no longer survive
in Japan, having been eclipsed by more concrete and sensuous
arguments, yet it is necessary to state them in order to show:
first, what Buddhism really is; second, doctrinal development in
the farthest East; and, third, the peculiarities of the Japanese
mind.</p>
<p>In this task, we are happy to be able to rely upon native
witness and confession.<a id="footnotetag8-4" name=
"footnotetag8-4"></a><a href="#footnote8-4"><sup>4</sup></a> The
foreigner may easily misrepresent, even when sincerely inclined to
utter only the truth. Each religion, in its theory at least, must
be judged by its ideals, and not by its failures. Its truth must be
stated by its own professors. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page231" id="page231"></a>{231}</span> In the "History of The
Twelve Japanese Sects," by Bunyiu Nanjio, M.A. Oxon., and in "Le
Bouddhisme Japonais," by Ryauon Fujishima, we have the untrammelled
utterances, of nine living lights of the religion of Shaka as it is
held and taught in Dai Nippon. The former scholar is a master of
texts, and the latter of philosophy, each editor excelling in his
own department; and the two books complement each other in
value.</p>
<p>Buddhism, being a logical growth out of Brahmanism, used the old
sacred language of India and inherited its vocabulary. In the
Tripitaka, that is, the three book-baskets or boxes, we have the
term for canon of scripture, in the complete collection of which
are <i>sutra</i>, <i>vinaya</i> and <i>abidharma</i>. We shall see,
also, that while Gautama shut out the gods, his speculative
followers who claimed to be his successors, opened the doors and
allowed them to troop in again. The democracy of the congregation
became a hierarchy and the empty swept and garnished house, a
pantheon.</p>
<p>A sutra, from the root <i>siv</i>, to sew, means a thread or
string, and in the old Veda religion referred to household rites or
practices and the moral conduct of life; but in Buddhist
phraseology it means a body of doctrine. A shaster or shastra, from
the Sanskrit root <i>&ccedil;as</i>, to govern, relates to
discipline. Of those shastras and sutras we must frequently speak.
In India and China some of those sutras are exponents, of schools
of thought or opinion, or of views or methods of looking at things,
rather than of organizations. In Japan these schools of philosophy,
in certain instances, become sects with a formal history.</p>
<p>In China of the present day, according to a Japanese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id=
"page232"></a>{232}</span> traveller and author, "the Chinese
Buddhists seem ... to unite all different sects, so as to make one
harmonious sect." The chief divisions are those of the blue robe,
who are allied with the Lamaism of Tibet and whose doctrine is
largely "esoteric," and those of the yellow robe, who accept the
three fundamentals of principle, teaching and discipline. Dhyana or
contemplation is their principle; the K&eacute;gon or Avatamsaka
sutra and the Hokk&eacute; or Saddharma Pundarika sutra, etc., form
the basis of their teaching; and the Vinaya of the Four Divisions
(Dharmagupta) is their discipline. On the contrary, in Japan there
are vastly greater diversities of sect, principle, teaching and
discipline.</p>
<h3>Buddhism as a System of Metaphysics.</h3>
<p>The date of the birth of the Buddha in India, accepted by the
Japanese scholars is B.C. 1027&mdash;the day and month being also
given with suspicious accuracy. About nine centuries after Gautama
had attained Nirvana, there were eighteen schools of the Hinayana
or the doctrine of the Smaller Vehicle. Then a shastra or institute
of Buddhist ontology in nine chapters, was composed, the title of
which in English, is, Book of the Treasury of Metaphysics. It had
such a powerful influence that it was called an
intelligence-creating, or as we say, an epoch-making book.</p>
<p>This Ku-sha shastra, from the Sanskrit <i>kosa</i>, a store, is
eclectic, and contains nine chapters embodying the views of one of
the schools, with selections from those of others. It was
translated in A.D. 563, into Chinese by a Hindu scholar; but about
a hundred years later the famous pilgrim, whom the Japanese call
Gen-j[=o], but <span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id=
"page233"></a>{233}</span> who is known in Europe as Hiouen
Thsang,<a id="footnotetag8-5" name="footnotetag8-5"></a><a href=
"#footnote8-5"><sup>5</sup></a> made a better translation, while
his disciples added commentaries.</p>
<p>In A.D. 658, two Japanese priests<a id="footnotetag8-6" name=
"footnotetag8-6"></a><a href="#footnote8-6"><sup>6</sup></a> made
the sea-journey westward into China, as Gen-j[=o] had before made
the land pilgrimage into India, and became pupils of the famous
pilgrim. After long study they returned, bringing the Chinese
translation of this shastra into Japan. They did not form an
independent sect; but the doctrines of this shastra, being
eclectic, were studied by all Japanese Buddhist sects. This Ku-sha
scripture is still read in Japan as a general institute of
ontology, especially by advanced students who wish to get a general
idea of the doctrines. It is full of technical terms, and is well
named The Store-house of Metaphysics.</p>
<p>The Ku-sha teaches control of the passions, and the government
of thought. The burden of its philosophy is materialism; that is,
the non-existence of self and the existence of the matter which
composes self, or, as the Japanese writer says: "The reason why all
things are so minutely explained in this shastra is to drive away
the idea of self, and to show the truth in order to make living
beings reach Nirvana." Among the numerous categories, to express
which many technical terms are necessary, are those of "forms,"
eleven in number, including the five senses and the six objects of
sense; the six kinds of knowledge; the forty-six mental qualities,
grouped under six heads; and the fourteen conceptions separated
from the mind; thus making in all seventy-two compounded things and
three immaterial things. These latter are "conscious cessation of
existence," "unconscious cessation of existence," and "space."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id=
"page234"></a>{234}</span>
<p>The Reverend Shuzan Emura, of the Shin-shu sect of Japan, after
specifying these seventy-five Dharmas, or things compounded and
things immaterial, says:<a id="footnotetag8-7" name=
"footnotetag8-7"></a><a href="#footnote8-7"><sup>7</sup></a> "The
former include all things that proceed from a cause. This cause is
Karma, to which everything existing is due, Space and Nirvana alone
excepted. Again, of the three immaterial things the last two are
not subjects to be understood by the wisdom not free from frailty.
Therefore the 'conscious cessation of existence' is considered as
being the goal of all effort to him who longs for deliverance from
misery."</p>
<p>In a word, this one of the many Buddhisms of Asia is vastly less
a religion, in any real sense of the word, than a system of
metaphysics. However, the doctrine to be mastered is graded in
three Yanas or Vehicles; for there are now, as in the days of
Shaka, three classes of being, graded according to their ability or
power to understand "the truth." These are:</p>
<p>(I.) The Sho-mon or lowest of the disciples of Shaka, or hearers
who meditate on the cause and effect of everything. If acute in
understanding, they become free from confusion after three births;
but if they are dull, they pass sixty kalpas<a id="footnotetag8-8"
name="footnotetag8-8"></a><a href="#footnote8-8"><sup>8</sup></a>
or aeons before they attain to the state of enlightenment.</p>
<p>(II.) The Engaku or Pratyeka Buddhas, that is, "singly
enlightened," or beings in the middle state, who must extract the
seeds or causes of actions, and must meditate on the twelve chains
of causation, or understand the non-eternity of the world, while
gazing upon the falling flowers or leaves. They attain
enlightenment after four births or a hundred kalpas, according to
their ability.</p>
<p>(III.) The Bodhisattvas or Buddhas-elect, who practise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id=
"page235"></a>{235}</span> the six perfections (perfect practice of
alms-giving, morality, patience, energy, meditation and wisdom) as
preliminaries to Nirvana, which they reach only after countless
kalpas.</p>
<p>These three grades of pupils in the mysteries of Buddha
doctrine, are said to have been ordered by Shaka himself, because
understanding human beings so thoroughly, he knew that one person
could not comprehend two ways or vehicles (Yana) at once. People
were taught therefore to practise anyone of the three vehicles at
pleasure.</p>
<p>We shall see how the later radical and democratic Japanese
Buddhism swept away this gradation, and declaring but the one
vehicle (&eacute;ka), opened the kingdom to all believers.</p>
<p>The second of the early Japanese schools of thought, is the
J[=o]-jitsu,<a id="footnotetag8-9" name=
"footnotetag8-9"></a><a href="#footnote8-9"><sup>9</sup></a> or the
sect founded chiefly upon the shastra which means The Book of the
Perfection of the Truth, containing selections from and
explanations of the true meaning of the Tripitaka. This shastra was
the work of a Hindu whose name means Lion-armor, and who lived
about nine centuries after Gautama. Not satisfied with the narrow
views of his teacher, who may have been of the Dharmagupta school
(of the four Disciplines), he made selections of the best and
broadest interpretations then current in the several different
schools of the Smaller Vehicle. The book is eclectic, and attempts
to unite all that was best in each of the Hinayana schools; but
certain Chinese teachers consider that its explanations are
applicable to the Great Vehicle also. Translated into Chinese in
406 A.D., the commentaries upon it soon numbered hundreds, and it
was widely expounded and lectured upon. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>{236}</span>
Commentaries upon this shastra were also written in Korean by
D[=o]-z[=o]. From the peninsula it was introduced into Japan. This
J[=o]-jitsu doctrine was studied by prince Sh[=o]toku, and
promulgated as a division of the school called San-Ron. The
students of the J[=o]-jitsu school never formed in Japan a distinct
organization.</p>
<p>The burden of the teachings of this school is pure nihilism, or
the non-existence of both self and of matter. There is an utter
absence of substantiality in all things. Life itself is a prolonged
dream. The objects about us are mere delusive shadows or mirage,
the product of the imagination alone. The past and the future are
without reality, but the present state of things only stands as if
it were real. That is to say: the true state of things is
constantly changing, yet it seems as if the state of things were
existing, even as does a circle of fire seen when a rope watch is
turned round very quickly.</p>
<h3>Japanese Pilgrims to China.</h3>
<p>The Ris-shu or Vinaya sect is one of purely Chinese origin, and
was founded, or rather re-founded, by the Chinese priest D[=o]sen,
who lived on Mount Shunan early in the seventh century, and claimed
to be only re-proclaiming the rules given by Gautama himself. He
was well acquainted with the Tripitaka and especially versed in the
Vinaya or rules of discipline. His purpose was to unite the
teachings of both the Greater and the Lesser Vehicle in a sutra
whose burden should be one of ethics and not of dogma.</p>
<p>The founder of this sect was greatly honored by the Chinese
Emperor. Furthermore, he was honored in <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>{237}</span> vision by
the holy Pindola or Binzura,<a id="footnotetag8-10" name=
"footnotetag8-10"></a><a href="#footnote8-10"><sup>10</sup></a> who
praised the founder as the best man that had promulgated the
discipline since Buddha himself. In later centuries, successors of
the founder compiled commentaries and reproclaimed the teachings of
this sect.</p>
<p>In A.D. 724 two Japanese priests went over to China, and having
mastered the Ris-shu doctrine, received permission to propagate it
in Japan. With eighty-two Chinese priests they returned a few years
later, having attempted, it is said, the journey five times and
spent twelve years on the sea. On their return, they received an
imperial invitation to live in the great monastery at Nara, and
soon their teachings exerted a powerful influence on the court. The
emperor, empress and four hundred persons of note were received
into the Buddhist communion by a Chinese priest of the Ris-shu
school in the middle of the eighth century. The Mikado Sh[=o]-mu
resigned his throne and took the vow and robes of a monk, becoming
H[=o]-[=o] or cloistered emperor. Under imperial direction a great
bronze image of the Vairokana Buddha, or Perfection of Morality,
was erected, and terraces, towers, images and all the paraphernalia
of the new kind of Buddhism were prepared. Even the earth was
embroidered, as it were, with sutras and shastras. Symbolical
landscape gardening, which, in its mounds and paths, variously
shaped stones and lanterns, artificial cascades and streamlets,
teaches the holy geography as well as the allegories and hidden
truths of Buddhism, made the city of Nara beautiful to the eyes of
faith as well as of sight.</p>
<p>This sect, with its excellence in morality and benevolence,
proved itself a beautifier of human life, of society and of the
earth itself. Its work was an <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page238" id="page238"></a>{238}</span> irenicon. It occupied
itself exclusively with the higher ethics, the higher meditations
and the higher knowledge. Interdicting what was evil and
prescribing what was good, its precepts varied in number and rigor
according to the status of the disciple, lay or clerical. It is by
the observance of the <i>sila</i>, or grades of moral perfection,
that one becomes a Buddha. Besides making so powerful a conquest at
the southern capital, this sect was the one which centuries
afterward built the first Buddhist temple in Yedo. Being ordinary
human mortals, however, both monk and layman occasionally
illustrated the difference between profession and practice.</p>
<p>These three schools or sects, Ku-sha, J[=o]-jitsu, and Ris-shu,
may be grouped under the Hinayana or Smaller Vehicle, with more or
less affiliation with Southern Buddhism; the others now to be
described were wholly of the Northern division.</p>
<p>The Hoss[=o]-shu, or the Dharma-lakshana sect, as described by
the Rev. Dai-ryo Takashi of the Shin-gon sect, is the school which
studies the nature of Dharmas or things. The three worlds of
desire, form and formlessness, consist in thought only; and there
is nothing outside thought. Nine centuries after Gautama,
Maitreya,<a id="footnotetag8-11" name=
"footnotetag8-11"></a><a href="#footnote8-11"><sup>11</sup></a> or
the Buddha of kindness, came down from the heaven of the
Bodhisattva to the lecture-hall in the kingdom in central India at
the request of the Buddhas elect, and discounted five shastras.
After that two Buddhist fathers who were brothers, composed many
more shastras and cleared up the meaning of the Mah[=a]yan[=a]. In
629 A.D., in his twenty-ninth year, the famous Chinese pilgrim,
Gen-j[=o] (Hiouen-thsang), studied these shastras and sciences,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id=
"page239"></a>{239}</span> and returning to China in 645 A.D.,
began his great work of translation, at which he continued for
nineteen years. One of his disciples was the author of a hundred
commentaries on sutras and shastras. The doctrines of Gen-j[=o] and
his disciples were at four different times, from 653 to 712 A.D.,
imported into Japan, and named, after the monasteries in which they
were promulgated, the Northern and Southern Transmission.</p>
<h3>The Middle Path.</h3>
<p>The burden of the teachings of this sect is subjective idealism.
They embrace principles enjoining complete indifference to mundane
affairs, and, in fact, thorough personal nullification and the
ignoring of all actions by its disciples. In these teachings,
thought only, is real. As we have already seen with the Ku-sha
teaching, human beings are of three classes, divided according to
intellect, into higher, middle and lower, for whom the systems of
teachings are necessarily of as many kinds. The order of progress
with those who give themselves to the study of the Hoss[=o] tenets,
is,<a id="footnotetag8-12" name="footnotetag8-12"></a><a href=
"#footnote8-12"><sup>12</sup></a> first, they know only the
existence of things, then the emptiness of them, and finally they
enter the middle path of "true emptiness and wonderful
existence."</p>
<p>From the first, such discipline is long and painful, and
ultimate victory scarcely comes to the ordinary being. The
disciple, by training in thought, by destroying passions and
practices, by meditating on the only knowledge, must pass through
three kalpas or aeons. Constantly meditating, and destroying the
two obstacles of passion and cognizable things, the disciple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id=
"page240"></a>{240}</span> then obtains four kinds of wisdom and
truly attains perfect enlightenment or Pari-Nirvana.</p>
<p>The San-ron Shu, as the Three-Shastra sect calls itself, is the
sect of the Teachings of Buddha's whole life.<a id=
"footnotetag8-13" name="footnotetag8-13"></a><a href=
"#footnote8-13"><sup>13</sup></a> Other sects are founded upon
single sutras, a fact which makes the student liable to narrowness
of opinion. The San-ron gives greater breadth of view and
catholicity of opinion. The doctrines of the Greater Vehicle are
the principal teachings of Gautama, and these are thoroughly
explained in the three shastras used by this sect, which, it is
claimed, contain Buddha's own words. The meanings of the titles of
the three favorite sutras, are, The Middle Book, The Hundred, and
The Book of Twelve Gates. Other books of the canon are also studied
and valued by this sect, but all of them are apt to be perused from
a particular point of view; <i>i.e.</i>, that of Pyrronism or
infinite negation.</p>
<p>There are two lines of the transmission of this doctrine, both
of them through China, though, the introduction to Japan was made
from Korea, in 625 A.D. Not to dwell upon the detail of history,
the burden of this sect's teaching, is, infinite negation or
absolute nihilism. Truth is the inconceivable state, or, in the
words of the Japanese writer: "The truth is nothing but the state
where thoughts come to an end; the right meditation is to perceive
this truth. He who has obtained this meditation is called Buddha.
This is this doctrine of the San-ron sect."</p>
<p>This sect, by its teachings of the Middle Path, seems to furnish
a bridge from the Hinayana or Southern school, to the
Mah[=a]yan[=a] or Northern school of Buddhism. Part of its work, as
set forth by the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id=
"page241"></a>{241}</span> Rev. K[=o]-ch[=o] Ogurasu, of the Shin
sect, is to defend the authenticity, genuineness and canonicity of
the books which form the Northern body of scriptures.</p>
<p>In these two sects Hos-s[=o] and San-ron, called those of Middle
Path, and much alike in principle and teaching, the whole end and
aim of mental discipline, is nihilism&mdash;in the one case
subjective, and in the other absolute, the end and goal being
nothing&mdash;this view into the nature of things being considered
the right one.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that such teachings could in the long run
satisfy neither the trained intellects nor the unthinking common
people of Japan? Is it far from the truth to suspect that, even
when accepted by the Japanese courtiers and nobles, they were
received, only too often, in a Platonic, not to say a Pickwickian,
sense? The Japanese is too polite to say "no" if he can possibly
say "yes," even when he does not mean it; while the common people
all over the world, as between metaphysics and polytheism, choose
the latter. Is it any wonder that, along with this propagation of
Nihilism as taught in the cloisters and the court, history informs
us of many scandals and much immorality between the women of the
court and the Buddhist monks?</p>
<p>Such dogmas were not able to live in organized forms, after the
next importations of Buddhism which came in, not partly but wholly,
under the name of the Mah[=a]yan[=a] or Great Vehicle, or Northern
Buddhism. By the new philosophy, more concrete and able to appeal
more closely to the average man, these five schools, which, in
their discussions, dealt almost wholly with <i>noumena</i>, were
absorbed. As matter of fact, none of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page242" id="page242"></a>{242}</span> them is now in existence,
nor can we trace them, speaking broadly, beyond the tenth century.
Here and there, indeed, may be a temple bearing the name of one of
the sects, or grades of doctrine, and occasionally an eccentric
individual who "witnesses" to the old metaphysics; but these are
but fossils or historical relics, and are generally regarded as
such.</p>
<p>Against such baldness of philosophy not only might the
cultivated Japanese intellect revolt and react, but as yet the
common people of Japan, despite the modern priestly boast of the
care of the imperial rulers for what the bonzes still love to call
"the people's religion," were but slightly touched by the Indian
faith.</p>
<h3>The Great Vehicle.</h3>
<p>The K&eacute;gon-Shu or Avatamsaka-sutra sect, is founded on a
certain teaching which Gautama is said to have promulgated in nine
assemblies held at seven different places during the second week of
his enlightenment. This sutra exists in no fewer than six texts,
around each of which has gathered some interesting mythology. The
first two tests were held in memory and not committed to palm
leaves; the second pair are secretly preserved in the dragon palace
of Riu-gu<a id="footnotetag8-14" name=
"footnotetag8-14"></a><a href="#footnote8-14"><sup>14</sup></a>
under the sea, and are not kept by the men of this world. The fifth
text of 100,000 verses, was obtained by a Bodhisattva from the
palace of the dragon king of the world under the sea and
transmitted to men in India. The sixth is the abridged text.</p>
<p>It concerns us to notice that the shorter texts were translated
into Chinese in the fourth century, and that later, other
translations were made&mdash;36,000 verses of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>{243}</span> the fifth
text, 45,000 verses of the sixth text, etc. When the doctrine of
the sect had been perfected by the fifth patriarch and he lectured
on the sutra, rays of white light came from his mouth, and there
rained wonderful heavenly flowers. In A.D. 736 a Chinese Vinaya
teacher or instructor in Buddhist discipline, named D[=o]-sen,
first brought the K&eacute;gon scriptures to Japan. Four years
later a Korean priest gave lectures on them in the Golden-Bell Hall
of the Great Eastern Monastery at Nara. He completed his task of
expounding the sixty volumes in three years. Henceforth, lecturing
on this sutra became one of the yearly services of the Eastern
Great Monastery.</p>
<p>"The K&eacute;-gon sutra is the original book of Buddha's
teachings of his whole life. All his teachings therefore sprang
from this sutra. If we attribute all the branches to the origin, we
may say that there is no teaching of Buddha for his whole life
except this sutra."<a id="footnotetag8-15" name=
"footnotetag8-15"></a><a href="#footnote8-15"><sup>15</sup></a> The
title of the book, when literally translated, is
Great-square-wide-Buddha-flower-adornment-teaching&mdash;a title
sufficiently indicative of its rhetoric. The age of hard or bold
thinking was giving way to flowery diction, and the Law was to be
made easy through fine writing.</p>
<p>The burden of doctrine is the unconditioned or realistic,
pantheism. Nature absolute, or Buddha-tathata, is the essence of
all things. Essence and form were in their origin combined and
identical. Fire and water, though phenomenally different, are from
the point of view of Buddha-tathata absolutely identical. Matter
and thought are one&mdash;that is Buddha-tathata. In teaching,
especially the young, it must be remembered that the mind resembles
a fair page upon which the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page244"
id="page244"></a>{244}</span> artist might trace a design, especial
care being needed to prevent the impression of evil thoughts, in
order to accomplish which one must completely and always direct the
mind to Buddha.<a id="footnotetag8-16" name=
"footnotetag8-16"></a><a href="#footnote8-16"><sup>16</sup></a> One
notable sentence in the text is, "when one first raises his
thoughts toward the perfect knowledge, he at once becomes fully
enlightened."</p>
<p>In some parts of the metaphysical discussions of this sect we
are reminded of European mediaeval scholasticism, especially of
that discussion as to how many angels could dance on the point of a
cambric needle without jostling each other. It says, "Even at the
point of one grain of dust, of immeasurable and unlimited worlds,
there are innumerable Buddhas, who are constantly preaching the
K&eacute;-gon ki[=o] (sutra) throughout the three states of
existence, past, present and future, so that the preaching is not
at all to be collected.<a id="footnotetag8-17" name=
"footnotetag8-17"></a><a href="#footnote8-17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h3>A New Chinese Sect.</h3>
<p>In its formal organization the Ten-dai sect is of Chinese
origin. It is named after Tien Tai,<a id="footnotetag8-18" name=
"footnotetag8-18"></a><a href="#footnote8-18"><sup>18</sup></a> a
mountain in China about fifty miles south of Ningpo, on which the
book which forms the basis of its tenets was composed by Chi-sha,
now canonized as a Dai Shi or Great teacher. Its special doctrine
of completion and suddenness was, however, transmitted directly
from Shaka to Vairokana and thence to Maitreya, so that the
apostolical succession of its orthodoxy cannot be questioned.</p>
<p>The metaphysics of this sect are thought to be the most profound
of the Greater Vehicle, combining into a system the two opposite
ideas of being and not being. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page245" id="page245"></a>{245}</span> The teachers encourage all
men, whether quick or slow in understanding, to exercise the
principle of "completion" and "suddenness," together with four
doctrinal divisions, one or all of which are taught to men
according to their ability. The object of the doctrine is to make
men get an excellent understanding, practise good discipline and
attain to the great fruit of Enlightenment or Buddha-hood.</p>
<p>Out of compassion, Gautama appeared in the world and preached
the truth in several forms, according to the circumstances of time
and place. There are four doctrinal divisions of "completion,"
"secrecy," "meditation," and "moral precept," which are the means
of knowing the principle of "completion." From Gautama, Vairokana
and Maitreya the doctrine passed through more than twenty Buddhas
elect, and arrived in China on the twentieth day of the twelfth
month, A.D. 401. The delivery to disciples was secret, and the term
used for this esoteric transmission means "handed over within the
tower."</p>
<p>In A.D. 805, two Japanese pilgrims went to China, and received
orthodox training. With twenty others, they brought the Ten-dai
doctrines into Japan. During this century, other Japanese disciples
of the same sect crossed the seas to study at Mount Tien Tai. On
coming back to Japan they propagated the various shades of
doctrine, so that this main sect has many branches. It was chiefly
through these pilgrims from the West that the Sanskrit letters,
writing and literature were imported. In our day, evidences of
Sanskrit learning, long since neglected and forgotten, are seen
chiefly in the graveyards and in charms and amulets.</p>
<p>Although the philosophical doctrines of Ten-dai are <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>{246}</span> much the
same as those of the K&eacute;-gon sect, being based on pantheistic
realism, and teaching that the Buddha-tathata or Nature absolute is
the essence of all things, yet the Ten-dai school has striking and
peculiar features of its own. Instead of taking some particular
book or books in the canon, shastra, or sutra, selection or
collection, as a basis, the Chinese monk Chi-sha first mastered,
and then digested the whole canon. Then selecting certain doctrines
for emphasis he supported them by a wide range of quotation,
professing to give the gist of the pure teachings of Gautama rather
than those of his disciples. In practice, however, the Saddharma
Pundarika is the book most honored by this sect; the other sutras
being employed mainly as commentary. Furthermore, this sect makes
as strenuous a claim for the true apostolical succession from the
Founder, as do the other sects.</p>
<p>The teachers of Ten-dai doctrine must fully estimate character
and ability in their pupils, and so apportion instruction. In this
respect and in not a few others, they are like the disciples of
Loyola, and have properly been called the Jesuits of Buddhism. They
are ascetics, and teach that spiritual insight is possible only
through prolonged thought. Their purpose is to recognize the
Buddha, in all the forms he has assumed in order to save mankind.
Nevertheless, the highest truths are incomprehensible except to
those who have already attained to Buddha-hood.<a id=
"footnotetag8-19" name="footnotetag8-19"></a><a href=
"#footnote8-19"><sup>19</sup></a> In contrast to the Nichirenites,
who give an emotional and ultra-concrete interpretation and
expression to the great sutra, Hokk&eacute; Ki[=o], the Ten-dai
teachers are excessively philosophical and intellectual.</p>
<p>In its history the Ten-dai sect has followed out its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id=
"page247"></a>{247}</span> logic. Being realistic in pantheism, it
reverences not only Gautama the historic Buddha, but also, large
numbers of the Hindu deities, the group of idols called Jiz[=o],
the god Fudo, and Kuannon the god or goddess of mercy, under his or
her protean forms. In its early history this sect welcomed to its
pantheon the Shint[=o] gods, who, according to the scheme of
Riy[=o]bu Shint[=o], were declared to be avatars or manifestations
of Buddha. The three sub-sects still differ in their worship of the
avatars selected as supreme deities, but their philosophy enables
them to sweep in the Buddhas of every age and clime, name and
nation. Many other personifications are found honored in the
Ten-dai temples. At the gateways may usually be seen the colossal
painted and hideous images of the two Devas or kings (Ni-O). These
worthies are none other than Indra and Brahma of the old Vedic
mythology.</p>
<p>Space and time&mdash;which seem never to fail the Buddhists in
their literature&mdash;would fail us to describe this sect in full,
or to show in detail its teachings, wherein are wonderful
resemblances to European ideas and facts&mdash;in philosophy, to
Hegel and Spinoza find in history, to Jesuitism. Nor can we stay to
point out the many instances in which, invading the domain of
politics, the Ten-dai abbots with their armies of monks, having
made their monasteries military arsenals and issuing forth clad in
armor as infantry and cavalry, have turned the scale of battle or
dictated policies to emperors. Like the Praetorian guard of Rome or
the clerical militia in Spain, these men of keen intellect have
left their marks deep upon the social and political history of the
country in which they dwelt. They have understood thoroughly the
art of practising religion <span class="pagenum"><a name="page248"
id="page248"></a>{248}</span> for the sake of revenue. To secure
their ends, priests have made partnerships with other sects; in
order to hold Shint[=o] shrines, they have married to secure heirs
and make office hereditary; and finally in the Purification of
1870, when the Riy[=o]bu system was blown to the winds by the
Japanese Government, not a few priests of this sect became laymen,
in order to keep both office and emolument in the purified
Shint[=o] shrines.</p>
<h3>The Sect of the True Word.</h3>
<p>It is probable that the conquest and obliteration of Shint[=o]
might have been accomplished by some priest or priests of the
Ten-dai sect, had such a genius as K[=o]b[=o] been found in its
household; but this great achievement was reserved for the man who
introduced into Japan the Shin-gon Shu, or Sect of the True Word.
The term <i>gon</i> is the equivalent of Mantra,<a id=
"footnotetag8-20" name="footnotetag8-20"></a><a href=
"#footnote8-20"><sup>20</sup></a> a Sanskrit term meaning word, but
in later use referring to the mystic salutations addressed to the
Buddhist gods. "The doctrine of this sect is a great secret law. It
teaches us that we can attain to the state of the 'Great
Enlightened,' that is the state of 'Buddha,' while in the present
physical body, which was born of our parents (and which consists of
six elements,<a id="footnotetag8-21" name=
"footnotetag8-21"></a><a href="#footnote8-21"><sup>21</sup></a>
Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Ether, and Knowledge), if we follow the
three great secret laws, regarding Body, Speech, and
Thought."<a id="footnotetag8-22" name=
"footnotetag8-22"></a><a href="#footnote8-22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The history of the transmission of the doctrine from the
greatest of the spirit-bodied Buddhas to the historic founder,
Vagrabodhi, is carefully given. The latter was a man very learned
in regard to many doctrines of Buddhism and other religious, and
was especially <span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id=
"page249"></a>{249}</span> well acquainted with the deepest meaning
of the doctrine of this sect, which he taught in India for a
considerable time. The doctrine is recorded in several sutras, yet
the essential point is nothing but the Mandala, or circle of the
two parts, or, in Japanese, Riy[=o]bu.</p>
<p>The great preacher, Vagrabodhi, in 720 A.D., came with his
disciples to the capital of China, and translated the sacred books,
seventy-seven in number. This doctrine is the well-known
Yoga-chara, which has been well set forth by Doctor Edkins in his
scholarly volume on Chinese Buddhism. As "yoga" becomes in plain
English "yoke," and as "mantra" is from the same root as "man" and
"mind," we have no difficulty in recognizing the original meaning
of these terms; the one in its nobler significance referring to
union with Buddha or Gnosis, and the other to the thought taking
lofty expression or being debased to hocus-pocus in charm or
amulet. Like the history of so many Sanskrit words as now uttered
in every-day English speech, the story of the word mantra forms a
picture of mental processes and apparently of the degradation of
thought, or, as some will doubtless say, of the decay of religion.
The term mantra meant first, a thought; then thought expressed;
then a Vedic hymn or text; next a spell or charm. Such have been
the later associations, in India, China and Japan with the term
mantra.</p>
<p>The burden of the philosophy of the Shin-gon, looked at from one
point of view, is mysticism, and from another, pantheism. One of
the forms of Buddha is the principle of everything. There are ten
stages of thought, and there are two parts, "lengthwise" and
"crosswise" or exoteric and esoteric. Other doctrines <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>{250}</span> of
Buddhism represent the first, or exoteric stage; and those of the
Shin-gon or true word, the second, or esoteric. The primordial
principle is identical with that of Maha-Vairokana, one of the
forms<a id="footnotetag8-23" name="footnotetag8-23"></a><a href=
"#footnote8-23"><sup>23</sup></a> of Buddha. The body, the word and
the thought are the three mysteries, which being found in all
beings, animate and inanimate, are to be fully understood only by
Buddhas, and not by ordinary men.</p>
<p>To show the actual method of intellectual procedure in order to
reach Buddha-hood, many categories, tables and diagrams are
necessary; but the crowning tenet, most far reaching in its
practical influence, is the teaching that it is possible to reach
the state of Buddha-hood in this present body.</p>
<p>As discipline for the attainment of excellence along the path
marked out in the "Mantra sect," there are three mystic rites: (1)
worshipping the Buddha with the hand in certain positions called
signs; (2) repeating Dharani, or mystic formulas; (3)
contemplation.</p>
<p>K[=o]b[=o] himself and all those who imitated him, practised
fasting in order to clear the spiritual eyesight. The
thinking-chairs, so conspicuous in many old monasteries, though
warmed at intervals through the ages by the living bodies of men
absorbed in contemplation, are rarely much worn by the sitters,
because almost absolute cessation of motion characterizes the long
and hard thinkers of the Shin-gon philosophers. The idols in the
Shin-gon temples represent many a saint and disciple, who, by
perseverance in what a critic of Buddhism calls "mind-murder," and
the use of mystic finger twistings and magic formulas, has won
either the Nirvana or the penultimate stage of the Bodhisattva.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id=
"page251"></a>{251}</span>
<p>In the sermons and discourses of Shin-gon, the subtle points of
an argument are seized and elaborated. These are mystical on the
one side, and pantheistic on the other. It is easily seen how
Buddha, being in Japanese gods as well as men, and no being without
Buddha, the way is made clear for that kind of a marriage between
Buddhism and Shint[=o], in which the two become one, and that one,
as to revenue and advantage, Buddhism.</p>
<h3>Truth Made Apparent by One's Own Thought.</h3>
<p>The Japanese of to-day often speak of these seven religious
bodies which we have enumerated and described, as "the old sects,"
because much of the philosophy, and many of the forms and prayers,
are common to all, or, more accurately speaking, are popularly
supposed to be; while the priests, being celibates, refrain from
sak&eacute;, flesh and fish, and from all intimate relations with
women. Yet, although these sects are considered to be more or less
conformable to the canon of the Greater Vehicle, and while the last
three certainly introduce many of its characteristic
features&mdash;one sect teaching that Buddha-hood could be obtained
even in the present body of flesh and blood&mdash;yet the idea of
Paradise had not been exploited or emphasized. This new gospel was
to be introduced into Japan by the J[=o]-d[=o] Shu or Sect of the
Pure Land.</p>
<p>Before detailing the features of J[=o]-d[=o], we call attention
to the fact that in Japan the propagation of the old sects was
accompanied by an excessive use of idols, images, pictures, sutras,
shastras and all the furniture thought necessary in a Buddhist
temple. The course <span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id=
"page252"></a>{252}</span> of thought and action in the Orient is
in many respects similar to that in the Occident. In western lands,
with the ebb and flow of religious sentiment, the iconolater has
been followed by the iconoclast, and the overcrowded cathedrals
have been purged by the hammer and fire of the Protestant and
Puritan. So in Japan we find analogous, though not exactly similar,
reactions. The rise and prosperity of the believers in the Zen
dogmas, which in their early history used sparingly the eikon, idol
and sutra, give some indication of protest against too much use of
externals in religion. May we call them the Quakers of Japanese
Buddhism? Certainly, theirs was a movement in the direction of
simplicity.</p>
<p>The introduction of the Zen, or contemplative sect, did, in a
sense, both precede and follow that of Shingon. The word Zen is a
shortened form of the term Zenna, which is a transliteration into
Chinese of the Sanskrit word Dhyana, or contemplation. It teaches
that the truth is not in tradition or in books, but in one's self.
Emphasis is laid on introspection rather than on language. "Look
carefully within and there you will find the Buddha," is its chief
tenet. In the Zen monasteries, the chair of contemplation is, or
ought to be, always in use.</p>
<p>The Zen Shu movement may be said to have arisen out of a
reaction against the multiplication of idols. It indicated a return
to simpler forms of worship and conduct. Let us inquire how this
was.</p>
<p>It may be said that Buddhism, especially Northern Buddhism, is a
vast, complicated system. It has a literature and a sacred canon
which one can think of only in connection with long trains of
camels to carry, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id=
"page253"></a>{253}</span> or freight trains to transport, or ships
a good deal bigger than the Mayflower to import. Its multitudinous
rules and systems of discipline appall the spirit and weary the
flesh even to enumerate them; so that, from one point of view, the
making of new sects is a necessity. These are labor-saving
inventions. They are attempts to reduce the great bulk of
scriptures to manageable proportions. They seek to find, as it
were, the mother-liquor of the great ocean, so as to express the
truth in a crystal. Hence the endeavors to simplify, to condense;
here, by a selection of sutras, rather than the whole collection;
there, by emphasis on a single feature and a determination to put
the whole thing in a form which can be grasped, either by the elect
few or by the people at large.</p>
<p>The Zen sect did this in a more rational way than that set forth
as orthodox by later priestcraft, which taught that to the believer
who simply turned round the revolving library containing the canon,
the merit of having read it all would be imputed. The
rin-z[=o]<a id="footnotetag8-24" name=
"footnotetag8-24"></a><a href="#footnote8-24"><sup>24</sup></a>
found near the large temples,&mdash;the cunning invention of a
Chinese priest in the sixth century,&mdash;soon became popular in
Japan. The great wooden book-case turning on a pivot contains 6,771
volumes, that being the number of canonical volumes enumerated in
China and Japan.</p>
<p>The Zen sect teaches that, besides all the doctrines of the
Greater and the Lesser Vehicles, whether hidden or apparent, there
is one distinct line of transmission of a secret doctrine which is
not subject to any utterance at all. According to their tenet of
contemplation, one is to see directly the key to the thought of
Buddha by his own thought, thus freeing himself from <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>{254}</span> the
multitude of different doctrines&mdash;the number of which is said
to be eighty-four thousand. In fact, Zen Shu or "Dhyana sect"
teaches the short method of making truth apparent by one's own
thought, apart from the writings.</p>
<p>The story of the transmission of the true Zen doctrine is
this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When the blessed Shaka was at the assembly on Vulture's Peak,
there came the heavenly king, who offered the Buddha a
golden-colored flower and asked him to preach the law. The Blessed
One simply took the flower and held it in his hand, but said no
word. No one in the whole assembly could tell what he meant. The
venerable Mahahasyapa alone smiled. Than the Blessed One said to
him, 'I have the wonderful thought of Nirvana, the eye of the Right
Law, which I shall now give to you.'<a id="footnotetag8-25" name=
"footnotetag8-25"></a><a href="#footnote8-25"><sup>25</sup></a>
Thus was ushered in the doctrine of thought transmitted by
thought."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After twenty-eight patriarchs had taught the doctrine of
contemplation, the last came into China in A.D. 520, and tried to
teach the Emperor the secret key of Buddha's thought. This
missionary Bodhidharma was the third son of a king of the Kashis,
in Southern India, and the historic original of the tobacconist's
shop-sign in Japan, who is known as Daruma. The imperial Chinaman
was not yet able to understand the secret key of Buddha's thought.
So the Hindu missionary went to the monastery on Mount Su, where in
meditation, he sat down cross-legged with his face to a wall, for
nine years, by which time, says the legend, his legs had rotted off
and he looked like a snow-image. During that period, people did not
know him, and called him simply the Wall-gazing Brahmana. Afterward
he had a number of disciples, but they had different <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>{255}</span> views
that are called the transmissions of the skin, flesh, or bone of
the teacher. Only one of them got the whole body of his teachings.
Two great sects were formed: the Northern, which was undivided, and
the Southern, which branched off into five houses and seven
schools. The Northern Sect was introduced into Japan by a Chinese
priest in 729 A.D., while the Southern was not brought over until
the twelfth century. In both it is taught that perfect tranquillity
of body and mind is essential to salvation. The doctrine is the
most sublime one, of thought transmitted by thought being entirely
independent of any letters or words. Another name for them is, "The
Sect whose Mind Assimilates with Buddha," direct from whom it
claims to have received its articles of faith.</p>
<p>Too often this idea of Buddhaship, consisting of absolute
freedom from matter and thought, means practically mind-murder, and
the emptiness of idle reverie.</p>
<p>Contrasting modern reality with their ancient ideal, it must be
confessed that in practice there is not a little letter worship and
a good deal of pedantry; for, in all the teachings of abstract
principles by the different sects, there are endless puns or plays
upon words in the renderings of Chinese characters. This arises
from that antithesis of extreme poverty in sounds with amazing
luxuriance in written expression, which characterizes both the
Chinese and Japanese languages.</p>
<p>In the temples we find that the later deities introduced into
the Buddhist pantheon are here also welcome, and that the triads or
groups of three precious ones, the "Buddhist trinity,"
so-called,<a id="footnotetag8-26" name=
"footnotetag8-26"></a><a href="#footnote8-26"><sup>26</sup></a> are
surrounded by gods of Chinese or Japanese origin. The Zen sect,
according to its professions and early history, ought to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id=
"page256"></a>{256}</span> be indifferent to worldly honors and
emoluments, and indeed many of its devotees are. Its history,
however, shows how poorly mortals live up to their principles and
practise what they preach. Furthermore, these professors of peace
and of the joys of the inner life in the S[=o]-t[=o] or sub-sect
have made the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth years of Meiji, or A.D.
1893 and 1894, famous and themselves infamous by their
long-continued and scandalous intestine quarrels. Of the three
sub-sects, those called Rin-zai and S[=o]-t[=o], take their names
from Chinese monks of the ninth century; while the third, O-baku,
founded in Japan in the seventeenth century, is one of the latest
importations of Chinese Buddhistic thought in the Land of the
Rising Sun.</p>
<p>Japanese authors usually classify the first six denominations at
which we have glanced, some of which are phases of thought rather
than organizations, as "the ancient sects." Ten-dai and Shin-gon
are "the medieval sects." The remaining four, of which we shall now
treat, and which are more particularly Japanese in spirit and
development, are "the modern sects."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX - THE BUDDHISM OF THE JAPANESE</h2>
<h3>The Western Paradise.</h3>
<p>We cannot take space to show how, or how much, or whether at
all, Buddhism was affected by Christianity, though it probably was.
Suffice it to say that the J[=o]-d[=o] Shu, or Sect of the Pure
Land, was the first of the many denominations in Buddhism which
definitely and clearly set forth that especial peculiarity of
Northern Buddhism, the Western Paradise. The school of thought
which issued in J[=o]-d[=o] Shu was founded by the Hindoo, Memio.
In A.D. 252 an Indian scholar, learned in the Tripitaka, came to
China, and translated one of the great sutras, called Amitayus.
This sutra gives a history of Tathagata Amitabha,<a id=
"footnotetag9-1" name="footnotetag9-1"></a><a href=
"#footnote9-1"><sup>1</sup></a> from the first spiritual impulses
which led him to the attainment of Buddha-hood in remote Kalpas
down to the present time, when he dwells in the Western World,
called the Happy, where he receives all living beings from every
direction, helping them to turn away from confusion and to become
enlightened.<a id="footnotetag9-2" name=
"footnotetag9-2"></a><a href="#footnote9-2"><sup>2</sup></a> The
apocalyptic twentieth chapter of the Hokk&eacute; Ki[=o] is a
glorification of the transcendent power of the Tathagatas,
expressed in flamboyant oriental rhetoric.</p>
<p>We have before called attention to the fact that, with the
multiplication of sutras or the Sacred Canon and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>{260}</span> the vast
increase of the apparatus of Buddhism as well as of the hardships
of brain and body to be undergone in order to be a Buddhist, it was
absolutely necessary that some labor-saving system should be
devised by which the burden could be borne. Now, as a matter of
fact, all sects claim to found their doctrine on Buddha or his
work. According to the teaching of certain sects, the means of
salvation are to be found in the study of the whole canon, and in
the practice of asceticism and meditation. On the contrary, the new
lights of Buddhism who came as missionaries into China, protested
against this expenditure of so much mental and physical energy. One
of the first Chinese propagators of the J[=o]-d[=o] doctrine
declared that it was impossible, owing to the decay of religion in
his own age, for anyone to be saved in this way by his own efforts.
Hence, instead of the noble eight-fold path of primitive Buddhism,
or of the complicated system of the later Buddhistic Phariseeism of
India, he substituted for the difficult road to Nirvana, a simple
faith in the all-saving power of Amida. In one of the sutras it is
taught, that if a man keeps in his memory the name of Amida one
day, or seven days, the Buddha together with Buddhas elect, will
meet him at the moment of his death, in order to let him be born in
the Pure Land, and that this matter has been equally approved by
all other Buddhas of ten different directions.</p>
<p>One of the sutras, translated in China during the fifth century,
contains the teaching of Buddha, which he delivered to the wife of
the King of Magudha, who on account of the wickedness of her son
was feeling weary of this world. He showed her how she might be
born into the Pure Land. Three paths of good actions <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>{261}</span> were
pointed out. Toward the end of the particular sutra which he
advised her to read and recite, Buddha says: "Let not one's voice
cease, but ten times complete the thought, and repeat the formula,
of the adoration of Amida." "This practice," adds the Japanese
exegete and historian, "is the most excellent of all."</p>
<p>How well this latter teaching is practised may be demonstrated
when one goes into a Buddhist temple of the J[=o]-d[=o] sect in
Japan, and hears the constant refrain,&mdash;murmured by the score
or more of listeners to the sermon, or swelling like the roar of
the ocean's waves, on festival days, when thousands sit on the mats
beneath the fretted roof to enjoy the exposition of
doctrine&mdash;"Namu Amida Butsu"&mdash;"Glory to the Eternal
Buddha!"<a id="footnotetag9-3" name="footnotetag9-3"></a><a href=
"#footnote9-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The apostolical succession or transmission through the
patriarchs and apostles of India and China, is well known and
clearly stated, withal duly accredited and embellished with signs
and wonders, in the historical literature of the J[=o]-d[=o] sect.
In Buddhism, as in Christianity, the questions relating to True
Churchism, High Churchism, the succession of the apostles, teachers
and rulers, and the validity of this or that method of ordination,
form a large part of the literature of controversy. Nevertheless,
as in the case of many a Christian sect which calls itself the only
true church, the date of the organization of J[=o]-d[=o] was
centuries later than that of the Founder and apostles of the
original faith. Five hundred years after Zen-d[=o] (A.D. 600-650),
the great propagator of the J[=o]-d[=o] philosophy, H[=o]-nen, the
founder of the J[=o]-d[=o] sect, was born; and this phase of
organized Buddhism, like that of Shin Shu and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>{262}</span> Nichirer
Shu, may be classed under the head of Eastern or Japanese
Buddhism.</p>
<p>When only nine years of age, the boy afterward called H[=o]-nen,
was converted by his father's dying words. He went to school in his
native province, but his priest-teacher foreseeing his greatness,
sent him to the monastery of Hiy&eacute;izan, near Ki[=o]to. The
boy's letter of introduction contained only these words: "I send
you an image of the Bodhisattva, (Mon-ju) Manjusri." The boy shaved
his head and received the precepts of the Ten-dai sect, but in his
eighteenth year, waiving the prospect of obtaining the headship of
the great denomination, he built a hut in the Black Ravine and
there five times read through the five thousand volumes<a id=
"footnotetag9-4" name="footnotetag9-4"></a><a href=
"#footnote9-4"><sup>4</sup></a> of the Tripitaka. He did this for
the purpose of finding out, for the ordinary and ignorant people of
the present day, how to escape from misery. He studied Zen-d[=o]'s
commentary, and repeated his examination eight times. At last, he
noticed a passage in it beginning with the words, "Chiefly remember
or repeat the name of Amida with a whole and undivided heart." Then
he at once understood the thought of Zen-d[=o], who taught in his
work that whoever at any time practises to remember Buddha, or
calls his name even but once, will gain the right effect of going
to be born in the Pure Land after death. This Japanese student then
abandoned all sorts of practices which he had hitherto followed for
years, and began to repeat the name of Amida Buddha sixty thousand
times a day. This event occurred in A.D. 1175.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id=
"page263"></a>{263}</span>
<h3>H[=o]-nen, Founder of the Pure Land Sect.</h3>
<p>This path-finder to the Pure Land, who developed a special
doctrine of salvation, is best known by his posthumous title of
H[=o]-nen. During his lifetime he was very famous and became the
spiritual preceptor of three Mikados. After his death his biography
was compiled in forty-eight volumes by imperial order, and later,
three other emperors copied or republished it. In the history of
Japan this sect has been one of the most influential, especially
with the imperial and sh[=o]gunal families. In Ki[=o]to the
magnificent temples and monasteries of Chi[=o]n-in, and in
T[=o]ki[=o] Z[=o]-j[=o]-ji, are the chief seats of the two
principal divisions of this sect. The gorgeous
mausoleums,&mdash;well known to every foreign tourist,&mdash;at
Shiba and Uy&eacute;no in T[=o]ki[=o], and the clustered and
matchless splendors of Nikk[=o], belong to this sect, which has
been under the patronage of the illustrious line of the
Tokugawa,<a id="footnotetag9-5" name="footnotetag9-5"></a><a href=
"#footnote9-5"><sup>5</sup></a> while its temples and shrines are
numbered by many thousands.</p>
<p>The doctrine of the J[=o]-d[=o], or the Pure Land Sect, is
easily discerned. One of Buddha's disciples said, that in the
teachings of the Master there are two divisions or vehicles. In the
Maha-yana also there are two gates; the Holy path, and the Pure
Land. The Smaller Vehicle is the doctrine by which the immediate
disciples of Buddha and those for five hundred years succeeding,
practised the various virtues and discipline. The gateway of the
Maha-yana is also the doctrine, by which in addition to the
trainings mentioned, there are also understood the three virtues of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id=
"page264"></a>{264}</span> spiritual body, wisdom and deliverance.
The man who is able successfully to complete this course of
discipline and practice is no ordinary person, but is supposed to
possess merit produced from good actions performed in a former
state of existence. The doctrine by which man may do so, is called
the gate of the Holy Path.</p>
<p>During the fifteen hundred years after Buddha there were from
time to time, such personages in the world, who attained the end of
the Holy Path; but in these latter days people are more insincere,
covetous and contentious, and the discipline is too hard for
degenerate times and men. The three trainings already spoken of are
the correct causes of deliverance; but if people think them as
useless as last year's almanac, when can they complete their
deliverance? H[=o]-nen, deeply meditating on this, shut up the gate
of the Holy Path and opened that of the Pure Land; for in the
former the effective deliverance is expected in this world by the
three trainings of morality, thought and learning, but in the
latter the great fruit of going to be born in the Pure Land after
death, is expected through the sole practice of repeating Buddha's
name.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is not easy to accomplish the cause and effect of
the Holy Path, but both those of the doctrine of the Pure Land are
very easy to be completed. The difference is like that between
travelling by land and travelling by water.<a id="footnotetag9-6"
name="footnotetag9-6"></a><a href="#footnote9-6"><sup>6</sup></a>
The doctrines preached by the Buddha are eighty-four thousand in
number; that is to say, he taught one kind of people one system,
that of the Holy Path, and another kind that of the Pure Land. The
Pure Land doctrine of H[=o]-nen was derived from the sutra preached
by the great teacher Shaka.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id=
"page265"></a>{265}</span>
<p>This simple doctrine of "land travel to Paradise" was one which
the people of Japan could easily understand, and it became
amazingly popular. Salvation along this route is a case of being
"carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease, while others sought
to win the prize and sailed through bloody seas."</p>
<p>Largely through the influence of J[=o]-d[=o] Shu and of those
sects most closely allied to it, the technical terms, peculiar
phraseology and vocabulary of Buddhism became part of the daily
speech of the Japanese. When one studies their language he finds
that it is a complicated organism, including within itself several
distinct systems. Just as the human body harmonizes within itself
such vastly differing organized functions as the osseous,
digestive, respiratory, etc., so, embedded in what is called the
Japanese language, there are, also, a Chinese vocabulary, a polite
vernacular, one system of expression for superiors, another for
inferiors, etc. Last of all, there is, besides a peculiar system of
pronunciation taught by the priests, a Buddhist language, which
suggests a firmament of starry and a prairie of flowery metaphors,
with intermediate deeps of space full of figurative
expressions.</p>
<p>In our own mother tongue we have something similar. The dialect
of Canaan, the importations of Judaism, the irruptions of Hebraic
idioms, phrases and names into Puritanism, and the ejaculations of
the camp-meeting, which vein and color our English speech, may give
some idea of the variegated strains which make up the Japanese
language. Further, the peculiar nomenclature of the Fifth Monarchy
men, is fully paralleled in the personal names of priests and even
of laymen in Japan.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id=
"page266"></a>{266}</span>
<h3>Characteristics of the J[=o]-d[=o] Sect.</h3>
<p>H[=o]-nen teaches that the solution of abstract questions and
doctrinal controversies is not needed as means of grace to promote
the work of salvation. Whether the priests and their followers were
learned and devout, or the contrary, mattered little as regards the
final result, as all that is necessary is the continual repetition
of the prayer to Amida.</p>
<p>It may be added that his followers practise the master's
precepts with emphasis. Their incessant pounding upon wooden
fish-drums and bladder-shaped bells during their public exercises,
is as noisy as a frontier camp-meeting. The rosary is a notable
feature in the private devotions of the Buddhists, but the
J[=o]-d[=o] sect makes especial use of the double rosary, which was
invented with the idea of being manipulated by the left hand only;
this gave freedom to the right hand, "facilitating a happy
combination of spiritual and secular duty." At funerals of
believers a particular ceremony was exclusively practised by this
sect, at which the friends of the deceased sat in a circle facing
the priest, making as many repetitions as possible.<a id=
"footnotetag9-7" name="footnotetag9-7"></a><a href=
"#footnote9-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In Mohammedan countries, blind men, who cannot look down into
the surrounding gardens or house tops at the pretty women in or on
them, but who have clear and penetrating voices, are often chosen
us muezzins to utter the call to prayer from the minarets. On much
the same principle, in Old Japan, J[=o]-d[=o] priests, blind to
metaphysics, but handsome, elegantly dressed and with fine
delivery, went about the streets singing and intoning prayers, rich
presents being made to them, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page267" id="page267"></a>{267}</span> especially by the ladies.
The J[=o]-d[=o] people cultivate art and aesthetic ornamentation to
a notable degree. They also understand the art of fictitious and
sensational miracle-mongering. It is said that Zen-d[=o], the
famous Chinese founder of this Chinese sect, when writing his
commentary, prayed for a wonderful exhibition of supernatural
power. Thereupon, a being arrayed as a priest of dignified presence
gave him instruction on the division of the text in his first
volume. Hence Zen-d[=o] treats his own work as if it were the work
of Buddha, and says that no one is allowed either to add or to take
away even a word or sentence of the book.</p>
<p>The Pure Land is the western world where Amida lives. It is
perfectly pure and free from faults. Those who wish to go thither
will certainly be re-born there, but otherwise they will not. This
world, on the contrary, is the effect of the action of all beings,
so that even those who do not wish to be born here are nevertheless
obliged to come. This world is called the Path of Pain, because it
is full of all sorts of pains, such as birth, old age, disease,
death, etc. This is therefore a world not to be attached to, but to
be estranged and separated from. One who is disgusted with this
world, and who is filled with desire for that world, will after
death be born there. Not to doubt about these words of Buddha, even
in the slightest degree, is called deep faith; but if one
entertains the least doubts he will not be born there. Hence the
saying: "In the great sea of the law of Buddha, faith is the only
means to enter."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id=
"page268"></a>{268}</span>
<h3>Salvation Through the Merits of Another.</h3>
<p>In this absolute trust in the all-saving power of Amida as
compared with the ways promulgated before, we see the emergence of
the Buddhist doctrine of justification by faith, the simplification
of theology, and a revolt against Buddhist scholasticism. The
Japanese technical term, "<i>tariki</i>," or relying upon the
strength of another, renouncing all idea of <i>ji-riki</i> or
self-power,<a id="footnotetag9-8" name=
"footnotetag9-8"></a><a href="#footnote9-8"><sup>8</sup></a> is the
substance of the J[=o]-d[=o] doctrine; but the expanded term
<i>ta-riki chin no ji-riki</i>, or "self-effort depending on
another," while expressing the whole dogma, is rather scornfully
applied to the J[=o]-d[=o]ists by the men of the Shin sect. The
invocation of Amida is a meritorious act of the believer, much
repetition being the substance of this combination of personal and
vicarious work.</p>
<p>H[=o]-nen, after making his discovery, believing it possible for
all mankind eventually to attain to perfect Buddhaship, left, as we
have seen, the Ten-dai sect, which represented particularism and
laid emphasis on the idea of the elect. H[=o]-nen taught Buddhist
universalism. Belief and repetition of prayer secure birth into the
Pure Land after the death of the body, and then the soul moves
onward toward the perfection of Buddha-hood.</p>
<p>The Japanese were delighted to have among them a genius who
could thus Japanize Buddhism, and J[=o]-d[=o] doctrine went forth
conquering and to conquer. From the twelfth century, the tendency
of Japanese Buddhism is in the direction of universalism and
democracy. In later developments of J[=o]-d[=o], the pantheistic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id=
"page269"></a>{269}</span> tendencies are emphasized and the
syncretistic powers are enlarged. While mysticism is a striking
feature of the sect and the attainment of truth is by the grace of
Amida, yet the native Kami of Japan are logically accepted as
avatars of Buddha. History had little or no rights in the case;
philosophy was dictator, and that philosophy was H[=o]-nen's. Those
later Chinese deities made by personifying attributes or abstract
ideas, which sprang up after the introduction of Buddhism into
China, are also welcomed into the temples of this sect. That the
common people really believe that they themselves may attain
Buddha-hood at death, and enter the Pure Land, is shown in the fact
that their ordinary expression for the dead saint is
Hotok&eacute;&mdash;a general term for all the gods that were once
human. Some popular proverbs indicate this in a form that easily
lends itself to irreverence and merriment.</p>
<p>The whole tendency of Japanese Buddhism and its full momentum
were now toward the development of doctrine even to startling
proportions. Instead of the ancient path of asceticism and virtue
with agnosticism and atheism, we see the means of salvation put
now, and perhaps too easily, within the control of all. The pathway
to Paradise was made not only exceedingly plain, but also extremely
easy, perhaps even ridiculously so; while the door was open for an
outburst of new and local doctrines unknown to India, or even to
China. The rampant vigor with which Japanese Buddhism began to
absorb everything in heaven, earth and sea, which it could make a
worshipable object or cause to stand as a Kami or deity to the
mind, will be seen as we proceed. The native proverb, instead of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id=
"page270"></a>{270}</span> being an irreverent joke, stands for an
actual truth&mdash;"Even a sardine's head may become an object of
worship."</p>
<h3>"Reformed" Buddhism.</h3>
<p>We now look at what foreigners call "Reformed" Buddhism, which
some even imagine has been borrowed from Protestant
Christianity&mdash;notwithstanding that it is centuries older than
the Reformation in Europe.</p>
<p>The Shin Shu or True Sect, though really founded on the
J[=o]-d[=o] doctrines, is separate from the sect of the Pure Land.
Yet, besides being called the Shin Shu, it is also spoken of as the
J[=o]-d[=o] Shin Shu or the True Sect of the Pure Land. It is the
extreme form of the Protestantism of Buddhism. It lays emphasis on
the idea of salvation wholly through the merits of another, but it
also paints in richer tints the sensuous delights of the Western
Paradise. As the term Pure Land is antithetical to that of the Holy
Path, so the word Shin, or True, expresses the contrary of what are
termed the "temporary expedients."</p>
<p>While some say that we should practise good works, bring our
stock of merits to maturity, and be born in the Pure Land, others
say that we need only repeat the name of Amida in order to be born
in the Pure Land, by the merit produced from such repetition. These
doctrines concerning repetitions, however, are all considered but
"temporary expedients." So also is the rigid classification, so
prominent in "the old sects," of all beings or pupils into three
grades. As in Islam or Calvinism, all believers stand on a level.
To Shin-ran the Radical, the practices even of J[=o]-d[=o] seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id=
"page271"></a>{271}</span> complicated and difficult, and all that
appeared necessary to him was faith in the desire of Amida to bless
and save. To Shinran,<a id="footnotetag9-9" name=
"footnotetag9-9"></a><a href="#footnote9-9"><sup>9</sup></a> faith
was the sole saving act.</p>
<p>To rely upon the power of the Original Prayer of Amitabha Buddha
with the whole heart and give up all idea of <i>ji-riki</i> or
self-power, is called the truth. This truth is the doctrine of this
sect of Shin.<a id="footnotetag9-10" name=
"footnotetag9-10"></a><a href="#footnote9-10"><sup>10</sup></a> In
a word, not synergism, not faith <i>and</i> works, but faith only
is the teaching of Shin Shu.</p>
<p>Shinran, the founder of this sect in Japan, was born A.D. 1173
and died in the year 1262. He was very naturally one who had been
first educated in the J[=o]-d[=o] sect, then the ruling one at the
imperial court in Ki[=o]to. Shall we call him a Japanese Luther,
because of his insistence on salvation by faith only? He is
popularly believed to have been descended from one of the Shint[=o]
gods, being on his father's side the twenty-first in the line of
generation. On his mother's side he was of the lineage of the
Minamoto or Genji, a clan sprung from Mikados and famous during
centuries for its victorious warriors. H[=o]-nen was his teacher,
and like his teacher, Shinran studied at the great monastery near
Ki[=o]to, learning first the doctrine of the Tendai, and then, at
the age of twenty-nine, receiving from H[=o]-nen the tenets of the
J[=o]-d[=o] sect. Shortly after, at thirty years of age, he began
to promulgate his doctrines. Then he took a step as new to
Buddhism, as was Luther's union with Katharine von Bora, to the
ecclesiasticism of his time. He married a lady of the imperial
court, named Tamayori, who was the daughter of the Kuambaku or
premier.</p>
<p>Shinran thus taught by example, if not formally and by written
precept, that marriage was honorable, and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>{272}</span> that
celibacy was an invention of the priests not warranted by primitive
Buddhism. Penance, fasting, prescribed diet, pilgrimages, isolation
from society whether as hermits or in the cloister, and generally
amulets and charms, are all tabooed by this sect. Monasteries
imposing life-vows are unknown within its pale. Family life takes
the place of monkish seclusion. Devout prayer, purity, earnestness
of life and trust in Buddha himself as the only worker of perfect
righteousness, are insisted upon. Morality is taught to be more
important than orthodoxy.</p>
<p>In practice, the Shin sect even more than the J[=o]-d[=o],
teaches that it is faith in Buddha, which accomplishes the
salvation of the believer. Instead of waiting for death in order to
come under the protection of Amida, the faithful soul is at once
received into the care of the Boundlessly Compassionate. In a word,
the Shin sect believes in instantaneous conversion and
sanctification. Between the Roman and the Reformed soteriology of
Christendom, was Melancthonism or the co[=o]perate union of the
divine and the human will. So, the old Buddhism prior to Shinran
taught a phase of synergism, or the union of faith and works.
Shinran, in his "Reformed" Buddhism, taught the simplicity of
faith.</p>
<p>So also <i>in</i> regard to the sacred writings, Shinran opposed
the San-ron school and the three-grade idea. The scriptures of
other sects are in Sanskrit and Chinese, which only the learned are
able to read. The special writings of Shinran are in the
vernacular. Three of the sutras, also, have been translated into
Japanese and expressed in the kana script. Singleness of purpose
characterised this sect, which was often called Monto, or followers
of the gate, in reference <span class="pagenum"><a name="page273"
id="page273"></a>{273}</span> to its unity of organization, and the
opening of the way to all by Shinran and the doctrine taught by
him. Yet, lest the gate might seem too broad, the Shin teachers
insist that morality is as important as faith, and indeed the proof
of it. The high priests of Shin Shu have ever held a high position
and wielded vast influence in the religious development of the
people. While the temples of other sects are built in sequestered
places among the hills, those of Shin Shu are erected in the heart
of cities, on the main streets, and at the centres of
population,&mdash;the priests using every means within their power
to induce the people to come to them. The altars are on an imposing
scale of magnificence and gorgeous detail. No Roman Catholic church
or cathedral can outshine the splendor of these temples, in which
the way to the Western Paradise is made so clear and plain. Another
name for the sect is Ikko.</p>
<p>After the death of Shinran, his youngest daughter and one of his
grandsons erected a monastery near his tomb in the eastern suburbs
of Ki[=o]to, to which the Mikado gave the title of Hon-guanji, or
Monastery of the Original Vow. This was in allusion to the vow made
by Amida, that he would not accept Buddhaship except under the
condition that salvation be made attainable for all who should
sincerely desire to be born into his kingdom, and signify their
desire by invoking his name ten times.<a id="footnotetag9-11" name=
"footnotetag9-11"></a><a href="#footnote9-11"><sup>11</sup></a> It
is upon the passage in the sutra where this vow is recorded, that
the doctrine of the sect is based. Its central idea is that man is
to be saved by faith in the mercy of the boundlessly compassionate
Amida, and not by works or vain repetitions. Within our own time,
on November 28, 1876, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id=
"page274"></a>{274}</span> the present reigning Mikado bestowed
upon Shinran the posthumous title Ken-shin Dai-shi, or Great
Teacher of the Revelation of Truth.</p>
<h3>The Protestants of Japanese Buddhism.</h3>
<p>This is the sect which, being called "Reformed" Buddhism<a id=
"footnotetag9-12" name="footnotetag9-12"></a><a href=
"#footnote9-12"><sup>12</sup></a> and resembling Protestantism in
so many points, both large and minute, foreigners think has been
borrowed or imitated from European Protestantism.<a id=
"footnotetag9-13" name="footnotetag9-13"></a><a href=
"#footnote9-13"><sup>13</sup></a> As matter of fact, the foundation
principles of Shin-Shu are at least six hundred years old. They are
perfectly clear in the writings of the founder,<a id=
"footnotetag9-14" name="footnotetag9-14"></a><a href=
"#footnote9-14"><sup>14</sup></a> as well as in those of his
successor Renni[=o],<a id="footnotetag9-15" name=
"footnotetag9-15"></a><a href="#footnote9-15"><sup>15</sup></a> who
wrote the Ofumi or sacred writings, now daily read by the disciples
of this denomination. With the characteristic object of reaching
the masses, they are written, as we have shown, not in the mixed
Chinese and Japanese characters, but in the common script, or kana,
which all the people of both sexes can read. Within the last two
decades the Shin educators have been the first to organize their
schools of learning on the models of those in Christendom, so that
their young men might be trained to resist Shint[=o] or
Christianity, or to measure the truth in either. Their new temples
also show European influence in architecture and furniture. Liberty
of thought and action, and incoercible desire to be free from
governmental, traditional, ultra-ecclesiastical, or Shint[=o]
influence&mdash;in a word, protestantism in its pure sense, is
characteristic of the great sect founded by Shinran.</p>
<p>Indeed the Shin sect, which sprang out of the J[=o]-d[=o],
maintains that it alone professes the true teaching of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>{275}</span>
H[=o]-nen, and that the J[=o]-d[=o] sect has wandered from the
original doctrines of its founder. Whereas the J[=o]-d[=o] or Pure
Land sect believes that Amida will come to meet the soul of the
believer on its separation from the body, in order to conduct it to
Paradise, the Shin or True Sect of the Pure Land believes in
immediate salvation and sanctification. It preaches that as soon as
a man believes in Amida he is taken by him under him merciful
protection. Some might denominate these people the Methodists of
Buddhism.</p>
<p>One good point in their Protestantism is their teaching that
morality is of equal importance with faith. To them Buddha-hood
means the perfection and unlimitedness of wisdom and compassion.
"Therefore," writes one, "knowing the inability of our own power we
should believe simply in the vicarious Power of the Original
Prayer. If we do so, we are in correspondence with the wisdom of
the Buddha and share his great compassion, just as the water of
rivers becomes salt as soon as it enters the sea. For this reason
this is called the faith in the Other Power."</p>
<p>To their everlasting honor, also, the Shin believers have
probably led all other Japanese Buddhists in caring for the Eta,
even as they probably excel in preaching the true spiritual
democracy of all believers, yes, even of women.<a id=
"footnotetag9-16" name="footnotetag9-16"></a><a href=
"#footnote9-16"><sup>16</sup></a> "According to the earlier and
general view of Buddhism, women are condemned, in virtue of the
pollution of their nature, to look forward to rebirth in other
forms. By no possibility can they, in their existence as women,
reach the higher grades of holiness which lead to Nirvana.
According to the Shin Shu system, on the other hand, a believing
woman may hope to attain the goal of the Buddhist at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id=
"page276"></a>{276}</span> close of her present life."<a id=
"footnotetag9-17" name="footnotetag9-17"></a><a href=
"#footnote9-17"><sup>17</sup></a> This doctrine seems to be founded
on that passage in the eleventh chapter of the Saddharma Pundarika,
in which the daughter of S[=a]gara, the N[=a]ga-king, loses her sex
as female and reappears as a Bodhisattva of male sex.<a id=
"footnotetag9-18" name="footnotetag9-18"></a><a href=
"#footnote9-18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>The Shin sect is the largest in Japan, having more than twice as
many temples as any four of the great sects, and five thousand more
than the So-d[=o] or sub-sect of J[=o]-d[=o], which is the next
largest; or, over nineteen thousand in all. It is also supposed to
be one of the richest and most powerful of all the Japanese sects.
In reality, however, it possesses no fixed property, and is
dependent entirely upon the voluntary contributions of its
adherents. To-day, it is probably the most active of them all in
education, learning and missionary operations in Yezo, China and
Korea.</p>
<p>Interesting as is the development of the J[=o]-d[=o] and Shin
sects, which became popular largely through their promulgation of
dogmas founded on the Western Paradise, we must not forget that
both of them preached a new Buddha&mdash;not the real figure in
history, but an unhistoric and unreal phantom, the creation and
dream of the speculator and visionary. Amida, the personification
of boundless light, is one of the luxuriant growths of a sickly
scholasticism&mdash;a hollow abstraction without life or reality.
Amidaism is utterly repudiated by many Japanese Buddhists, who give
no place to his idol on their altars, and reject utterly the
teaching as to Paradise and salvation through the merits of
another.</p>
<p>Yet these two special developments by natives, though embodying
tendencies of the Japanese mind, did not reach the limit to which
Northern Buddhism <span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id=
"page277"></a>{277}</span> was to go in those almost incredible
lengths, which prompted Professor Whitney<a id="footnotetag9-19"
name="footnotetag9-19"></a><a href=
"#footnote9-19"><sup>19</sup></a> to call it "the high-faluting
school," and which we have seen in our own time under the
cultivation of western admirers.</p>
<h3>The Nichiren Sect.</h3>
<p>The Japanese mind runs to pantheism as naturally as an unpruned
grape-vine runs to fibre and leaves.</p>
<p>When Nichiren, the ultra-patriotic and ultra-democratic bonze,
saw the light in A.D. 1222, he was destined to bring religion not
only down to man, but even down to the beasts and to the mud. He
founded the Saddharma-Pundarika sect, now called Nichiren Shu.</p>
<p>Born at Kominato, near the mouth of Yedo Bay, he became a
neophite in the Shin-gon sect at the age of twelve, and was
admitted into the priesthood when but fifteen years old. Then he
adopted his name, which means Sun-lotus, because, according to a
typical dream very common in Korea and Japan, his mother thought
that she had conceived by the sun entering her body. Through a
miracle, he acquired a thorough knowledge of the whole Buddhist
canon, in the course of which he met with words, which he converted
into that formula which is constantly in the mouth of the members
of the Nichiren sect, Namu-my[=o]-ho-ren-g&eacute;-ky[=o]&mdash;"O,
the Sutra of the Lotus of the Wonderful Law."<a id=
"footnotetag9-20" name="footnotetag9-20"></a><a href=
"#footnote9-20"><sup>20</sup></a> His history, full of amazing
activity and of romantic adventure, is surrounded by a perfect
sunrise splendor, or, shall we say, sunset gorgeousness, of
mythology and fable. The scenes of his life are mostly laid in the
region of the modern T[=o]ki[=o], and to the cultivated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id=
"page278"></a>{278}</span> traveller, its story lends fascinating
charms to the landscape in the region of Yedo Bay. Nichiren was a
fiery patriot, and ultra-democratic in his sympathies. He was a
radical believer in "Japan for the Japanese." He was an
ecclesiastical <i>Soshi</i>. He felt that the developments of
Buddhism already made, were not sufficiently comprehensive, or
fully suited to the common people. So, in A.D. 1282, he founded a
new sect which gradually included within its pantheon all possible
Buddhas, and canonized pretty nearly all the saints, righteous men
and favorite heroes known to Dai Nippon. Nichiren first made Japan
the centre of the universe, and then brought religion down to the
lowest. He considered that the period in which he lived was the
latter day of the law, and that all creatures ought to share in the
merit of Buddha-hood. Only the original Buddha is the real moon in
the sky, but all Buddhas of the subordinate states are like the
images of the moon, reflected upon the waters. All these different
Buddhas, be they gods or men, beasts, birds or snakes, are to be
honored. Indeed, they are both honored and worshipped in the
Nichiren pantheon. Besides the historic Buddha, this sect, which is
the most idolatrous of all, admits as objects of its reverence such
personages as Nichiren, the founder; Kato Kiyomasa, the general who
led the army of invasion in Korea and was the persecutor of the
Christians; and Shichimen&mdash;a word which means seven points of
the compass or seven faces. This Shichimen is the being that
appeared to Nichiren as a beautiful woman, but disappeared from his
sight in the form of a snake, twenty feet long, covered with golden
scales and armed with iron teeth. It is now deified under the name
meaning <span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id=
"page279"></a>{279}</span> the Great God of the Seven Faces, and is
identified with the Hindoo deity Siva.</p>
<p>Another idol usually seen in the Nichiren temples is Mioken.
Under this name the pole star is worshipped, usually in the form of
a Buddha with a wheel of a Buddha elect. Standing on a tortoise,
with a sword in his right hand, and with the left hand half
open&mdash;a gesture which symbolizes the male and female
principles in the physical world, and the intelligence and the law
in the spiritual world&mdash;Mioken is a striking figure. Indeed,
the list of glorified animals reminds us somewhat of the ancient
beast-worship of Egypt. In the Nichiren hierology, it is as though
the symbolical figures in the Book of Revelation had been deified
and worshipped. It is evident that all the creatures in that
Buddhist chamber of imagery, the Hokk&eacute; Ki[=o], that could
possibly be made into gods have received apotheosis. The very book
itself is also worshipped, for the Nichirenites are extreme
believers in verbal inspiration, and pay divine honors to each jot
and tittle of the sutra, which to them is a god. They adore also
the triad of the three precious ones, the Buddha, the Rule or
Discipline, and the Organization; or, Being, Law, and Church. The
hideous idol, Fudo, "Eleven-faced," "Horse-headed,"
"Thousand-handed," or girt in a robe of fiery flame, is believed by
Buddhists to represent Avalokitesvara; but, in recent times he has
been recognized, detected and recaptured by the Shint[=o]ists as
Kotohira. The goddess Kishi, and that miscellaneous assortment or
group known as the Seven Patrons of Happiness, which form a sort of
encyclopaedia or museum of curiosities derived from the cults of
India, China and Japan, are also components <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>{280}</span> of the
amazing menagerie and pantheon of this sect, in which scholasticism
run mad, and emotional kindness to animals become maudlin, join
hands.</p>
<h3>The Ultra-realism of Northern Buddhism.</h3>
<p>Like most of the other Japanese sects, the Nichirenites claim
that their principles are contained in the Hok-k&eacute;-ki[=o],
which is considered the consummate white flower of Buddhist
doctrine and literature. This is the Japanese name for that famous
sutra, the Saddharma Pundarika, so often mentioned in these
chapters but a thousand-fold more so in Japanese literature. The
Ten-dai and the Nichiren sects are allied, in that both lay supreme
emphasis upon this sutra; but the former interprets it with an
intellectual, and the latter with an emotional emphasis.
Philosophically, the two bodies have much in common. Outwardly they
are very far apart. One has but to read their favorite scripture,
to see the norm upon which the gorgeous art of Japan has been
developed. Probably no single book in the voluminous canon of the
Greater Vehicle gives one so masterful a key to Japanese Buddhism.
Its pages are crowded with sensuous descriptions of all that is
attractive to both the reason and the understanding. Its
descriptions of Paradise are those which would suit also the
realistic Mussulman. Its rhetoric and visions seem to be those of
some oriental De Quincey, who, out of the dreams of an opium-eater,
has made the law-book of a religion. Translated into matter-of-fact
Chinese, none better than Nichiren knew how to present its realism
to his people.</p>
<p>In its ethical standards, which are two, this sect, like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id=
"page281"></a>{281}</span> most others, prescribes one course of
life for the monk, which is difficult, and another for the laity,
which is easy. The central dogma is that every part of the
universe, including not only gods and men, but animals, plants and
the very mud itself, is capable, by successive transmigrations, of
attaining to Buddhaship. In one sense, Nichirenism is the
transfiguration of atheistic evolution. In its teachings there are
also two forms: the one, largely in symbol, is intended to attract
followers; the other, the pure truth, is employed to convert the
obstinately ignorant, against their wills. As in the history of the
papal organization in Europe, a materialistic interpretation has
been given to the canons of dogma and discipline.</p>
<p>Contrary to the doctrine of those sects which teach the
attainment of salvation solely through the aid of Amida, or
Another, the Nichirenites insist that it is necessary for man to
work out his own salvation, by observing the law, by
self-examination, by reflecting on the blessings vouchsafed to the
members of this elect and orthodox sect and by constant prayer.
They consider themselves as in the only true church, and their
succession to the priesthood, the only valid one. The strict
Nichiren churchmen will not have the Shint[=o] gods in their
household shrines, nor will they intermarry among the sects. The
Nichirenites are also very fond of controversy, and their language
in speaking of other creeds and sects is not that characteristic of
the gentle Buddha. The people of this sect are much given to the
belief in demoniacal possession, and a considerable part of the
duty and revenue-yielding business of the Nichiren priests consists
in exorcising the foxes, badgers and other demons, which have
possessed <span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id=
"page282"></a>{282}</span> subjects who are generally women at
certain stages of illness or convalescence. The phenomena and
pathology of these disorders seem to be allied to those of hysteria
and hypnotism.</p>
<p>This popular sect also makes greatest use of charms, spells and
amulets, lays great store on pilgrimages, and is very fond of
noise-making instruments whether prayer-books or the wooden bells
or drums which are prominent features in their temples and revival
meetings. In one sense it is the Salvation Army of Buddhism, being
especially powerful in what strikes the eye and ear. The
Nichirenites have been well called the Ranters of Buddhism. Their
revival meetings make Bedlam seem silent, and reduce to gentle
murmurs the camp-meeting excesses with which we are familiar in our
own country. They are the most sectarian of all sects. Their
vocabulary of Billingsgate and the ribaldry employed by them even
against their Buddhist brethren, cast into the shade those of
Christian sectarians in their fiercest controversies. "A thousand
years in the lowest of the hells is the atonement prescribed by the
Nichirenites for the priests of all other sects." When the
Parliament of Religions was called in Chicago, the successors of
Nichiren, with their characteristic high-church modesty, promptly
sent letters to America, warning the world against all other
Japanese Buddhists, and denouncing especially those coming to speak
in the Parliament, as misrepresenting the true doctrines of
Buddha.</p>
<h3>Doctrinal Culmination.</h3>
<p>When the work of Nichiren had been completed, and his realistic
pantheism had been able to include <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page283" id="page283"></a>{283}</span> within its great receiver
and processes of Buddha-making, everything from gods to mud, the
circle of doctrine was complete. K[=o]b[=o]'s leaven had now every
possible lump in which to do its work. All grades of men in Japan,
from the most devout and intellectual to the most ranting and
fanatical, could choose their sect. Yet it may be that Buddhism in
Nichiren's day was in danger of stagnation and formalism, and
needed the revival which this fiery bonze gave it; for,
undoubtedly, along with zeal even to bigotry, came fresh life and
power to the religion. This invigoration was followed by the mighty
missionary labors of the last half of the thirteenth century, which
carried Buddhism out to the northern frontier and into Yezo.
Although, from time to time minor sects were formed either limiting
or developing further the principles of the larger parent sects,
and although, even as late as the seventeenth century, a new
subsect, the Oba-ku of Zen Shu, was imported from China, yet no
further doctrinal developments of importance took place; not even
in presence of or after sixteenth century Christianity and
seventeenth century Confucianism.</p>
<p>The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries form the golden age of
Japanese Buddhism.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth century, the feudal system had split into
fragments and the normal state of the country was that of civil
war. Sect was arrayed against sect, and the Shin bonzes,
especially, formed a great military body in fortified
monasteries.</p>
<p>In the first half of the sixteenth century, came the tremendous
onslaught of Portuguese Christianity. Then followed the militarism
and bloody persecutions of Nobunaga.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id=
"page284"></a>{284}</span>
<p>In clashing with the new Confucianism of the seventeenth
century, Buddhism utterly weakened as an intellectual power. Though
through the favor of the Yodo sh[=o]guns it recovered lands and
wealth, girded itself anew as the spy, persecutor and professed
extirpator of Christianity, and maintained its popularity with the
common people, it was, during the eighteenth century, among the
educated Japanese, as good as dead. Modern Confucianism and the
revival of Chinese learning, resulted in eighteenth century
scepticism and in nineteenth century agnosticism.</p>
<h3>The New Buddhism.</h3>
<p>In our day and time, Japanese Buddhism, in the presence of
aggressive Christianity, is out of harmony with the times, and the
needs of forty-one millions of awakened and inquiring people; and
there are deep searchings of heart. Politically disestablished and
its landed possessions sequestrated by the government, it has had,
since 1868, a history, first of depression and then of temporary
revival. Now, amid much mechanical and external activity, the
employment of the press, the organization of charity, of summer
schools of "theology," and of young men's and other associations
copied from the Christians, it is endeavoring to keep New Japan
within its pale and to dictate the future. It seeks to utilize the
old bottles for the new vintage.</p>
<p>There is, however, a movement discernible which may be called
the New Buddhism, and has not only new wine but new wineskins. It
is democratic, optimistic, empirical or practical; it welcomes
women and children; it is hospitable to science and every form of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id=
"page285"></a>{285}</span> truth. It is catholic in spirit and has
little if any of the venom of the old Buddhist controvertists. It
is represented by earnest writers who look to natural and spiritual
means, rather than to external and mechanical methods. As a whole,
we may say that Japanese Buddhism is still strong to-day in its
grip upon the people. Though unquestionably moribund, its death
will be delayed. Despite its apparent interest in, and harmony
with, contemporaneous statements of science, it does not hold the
men of thought, or those who long for the spiritual purification
and moral elevation of Japan.</p>
<p>Are the Japanese eager for reform? Do they possess that quality
of emotion in which a tormenting sense of sin, and a burning desire
for self-surrender to holiness, are ever manifest?</p>
<p>Frankly and modestly, we give our opinion. We think not. The
average Japanese man has not come to that self-consciousness, that
searching of heart, that self-seeing of sin in the light of a Holy
God's countenance which the gospel compels. Yet this is exactly
what the Japanese need. Only Christ's gospel can give it.</p>
<p>The average man of culture in Dai Nippon has to-day no religion.
He is waiting for one. What shall be the issue, in the contest
between a faith that knows no personal God, no Creator, no
atonement, no gospel of salvation from sin, and the gospel which
bids man seek and know the great First Cause, as Father and Friend,
and proclaims that this Infinite Friend seeks man to bless him, to
bestow upon him pardon and holiness and to give him earthly
happiness and endless life? Between one religion which teaches
personality <span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id=
"page286"></a>{286}</span> in God and in man, and another which
offers only a quagmire of impersonality wherein a personal god and
an individual soul exist only as the jack-lights of the marsh, mere
phosphorescent gleams of decay, who can fail to choose? Of the two
faiths, which shall be victor?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X - JAPANESE BUDDHISM IN ITS MISSIONARY
DEVELOPMENT</h2>
<h3>Missionary Buddhism the Measure of Japan's Civilization.</h3>
<p>Broadly speaking, the history of Japanese Buddhism in its
missionary development is the history of Japan. Before Buddhism
came, Japan was pre-historic. We know the country and people
through very scanty notices in the Chinese annals, by pale
reflections cast by myths, legends and poems, and from the relics
cast up by the spade and plough. Chinese civilization had filtered
in, though how much or how little we cannot tell definitely; but
since the coming of the Buddhist missionaries in the sixth century,
the landscape and the drama of human life lie before us in clear
detail. Speaking broadly again, it may be said that almost from the
time of its arrival, Buddhism became on its active side the real
religion of Japan&mdash;at least, if the word "religion" be used in
a higher sense than that connoted by either Shint[=o] or
Confucianism. Though as a nation the Japanese of the M&eacute;iji
era are grossly forgetful of this fact, yet, as Professor
Chamberlain says,<a id="footnotetag10-1" name=
"footnotetag10-1"></a><a href="#footnote10-1"><sup>1</sup></a> "All
education was for centuries in Buddhist hands. Buddhism introduced
art; introduced medicine; created the folk-lore of the country;
created its dramatic poetry; deeply influenced politics, and every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id=
"page290"></a>{290}</span> sphere of social and intellectual
activity; in a word, Buddhism was the teacher under whose
instruction the Japanese nation grew up."</p>
<p>For many centuries all Japanese, except here and there a stern
Shint[=o]ist, or an exceptionally dogmatic Confucian, have
acknowledged these patent facts, and from the emperor to the eta,
glorified in them. It was not until modern Confucian philosophy
entered the Mikado's empire in the seventeenth century, that
hostile criticism and polemic tenets denounced Buddhism, and
declared it only fit for savages. This bitter denunciation of
Buddhism at the lips and hands of Japanese who had become Chinese
in mind, was all the more inappropriate, because Buddhism had for
over a thousand years acted as the real purveyor and disperser of
the Confucian ethics and culture in Japan. Such denunciation came
with no better grace from the Yedo Confucianists than from the
Shint[=o] revivalists, like Moto&ouml;ri, who, while execrating
everything Chinese, failed to remember or impress upon his
countrymen the fact, that almost all which constituted Japanese
civilization had been imported from the Middle Kingdom.</p>
<p>Buddhism, in its purely doctrinal development, seems to be
rather a system of metaphysics than a true religion, being a
conglomeration, or rather perhaps an agglomeration, of all sorts of
theories relating to the universe and its contents. Its doctrinal
and metaphysical side, however, is to be carefully distinguished
from its popular and external features, for in its missionary
development Buddhism may be called a system of national
improvement. The history of its propagation, in the land farthest
east from its cradle, is not only the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>{291}</span> outline
of the history of Japanese civilization, but is nearly the whole of
it.</p>
<h3>Pre-Buddhistic Japan.</h3>
<p>It is not perhaps difficult to reconstruct in imagination the
landscape of Japan in pre-Buddhistic days. Certainly we may, with
some accuracy, draw a contrast between the appearance of the face
of the earth then and now. Supposing that there were as many as a
million or two of souls in the Japanese Archipelago of the sixth
century&mdash;the same area which in the nineteenth century
contains over forty-one millions&mdash;we can imagine only here and
there patches of cultivated fields, or terraced gullies. There were
no roads except paths or trails. The horse was probably yet a
curiosity to the aborigines, though well known to the sons of the
gods. Sheep and goats then, as now, were unknown. The cow and the
ox were in the land, but not numerous.<a id="footnotetag10-2" name=
"footnotetag10-2"></a><a href="#footnote10-2"><sup>2</sup></a> In
architecture there was probably little but the primeval hut. Tools
were of the rudest description; yet it is evident that the
primitive Japanese were able to work iron and apply it to many
uses. There were other metals, though the tell-tale etymology of
their names in Japanese metallurgy, as in so many other lines of
industry and articles of daily use, points to a Chinese origin. It
is the almost incredible fact that the Japanese man or woman wore
on the person neither gold nor silver jewelry. In later times,
decoration was added to the sword hilt and pins were thrust in the
hair.</p>
<p>Possibly a prejudice against metal touching the skin, such as
exists in Korea, may account for this absence of jewelry, though
silver was not discovered until A.D. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page292" id="page292"></a>{292}</span> 675, or gold until A.D.
749. The primitive Japanese, however, did wear ornaments of ground
and polished stone, and these so numerously as to compel contrast
with the severer tastes of later ages. Some of these
magatama&mdash;curved jewels or perforated cylinders&mdash;were
made of very hard stone which requires skill to drill, cut and
polish. Among the substances used was jade, a mineral found only in
Cathay.<a id="footnotetag10-3" name="footnotetag10-3"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-3"><sup>3</sup></a> Indeed, we cannot follow the lines
of industry and manufactures, of personal adornment and household
decoration, of scientific terms and expressions, of literary,
intellectual and religious experiment, without continually finding
that the Japanese borrowed from Chinese storehouses. Possibly their
debt began at the time of the alleged conquest of Korea<a id=
"footnotetag10-4" name="footnotetag10-4"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-4"><sup>4</sup></a> in the third century.</p>
<p>In Japanese life, as it existed before the introduction of
Buddhism, there was, with barbaric simplicity, a measure of culture
somewhat indeed above the level of savagery, but probably very
little that could be appraised beyond that of the Iroquois Indians
in the days of their Confederacy. For though granting that there
were many interesting features of art, industry, erudition and
civilization which have been lost to the historic memory, and that
the research of scholars may hereafter discover many things now in
oblivion; yet, on the other hand, it is certain that much of what
has long been supposed to be of primitive Japanese origin, and
existent before the eighth century, has been more or less infused
or enriched with Chinese elements, or has been imported directly
from India, or Persia,<a id="footnotetag10-5" name=
"footnotetag10-5"></a><a href="#footnote10-5"><sup>5</sup></a> or
has crystallized into shape from the mixture of things Buddhistic
and primitive Japanese.</p>
<p>Apart from all speculation, we know that in the train
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id=
"page293"></a>{293}</span> of the first missionaries came artisans,
and instructors in every line of human industry and achievement,
and that the importation of the inventions and appliances of "the
West"&mdash;the West then being Korea and China, and the "Far
West," India&mdash;was proportionately as general, as far-reaching,
as sensational, as electric in its effects upon the Japanese minds,
as, in our day, has been the introduction of the modern
civilization of Europe and the United States.<a id=
"footnotetag10-6" name="footnotetag10-6"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3>The Purveyors of Civilization.</h3>
<p>The Buddhist missionaries, in their first "enthusiasm of
humanity," were not satisfied to bring in their train, art,
medicine, science and improvements of all sorts, but they
themselves, being often learned and practical men, became personal
leaders in the work of civilizing the country. In travelling up and
down the empire to propagate their tenets, they found out the
necessity of better roads, and accordingly, they were largely
instrumental in having them made. They dug wells, established
ferries and built bridges.<a id="footnotetag10-7" name=
"footnotetag10-7"></a><a href="#footnote10-7"><sup>7</sup></a> They
opened lines of communication; they stimulated traffic and the
exchange of merchandise; they created the commerce between Japan
and China; and they acted as peacemakers and mediators in the wars
between the Japanese and Koreans. For centuries they had the
monopoly of high learning. In the dark middle ages when civil war
ruled, they were the only scholars, clerks, diplomatists, mediators
and peacemakers.</p>
<p>Japanese diet became something new under the direction of the
priests. The bonzes taught the wickedness of slaughtering domestic
animals, and indeed, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id=
"page294"></a>{294}</span> the wrong of putting any living thing to
death, so that kindness to animals has become a national trait. To
this day it may be said that Japanese boys and men are, at least
within the limits of their light, more tender and careful with all
living creatures than are those of Christendom.<a id=
"footnotetag10-8" name="footnotetag10-8"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-8"><sup>8</sup></a> The bonzes improved the daily fare
of the people, by introducing from Korea and China articles of food
hitherto unknown. They brought over new seeds and varieties of
vegetables and trees. Furthermore, necessity being the mother of
invention, not a few of the shorn brethren made up for the
prohibition of fish and flesh, by becoming expert cooks. They so
exercised their talents in the culinary art that their results on
the table are proverbial. Especially did they cultivate mushrooms,
which in taste and nourishment are good substitutes for fish.</p>
<p>The bonzes were lovers of beauty and of symbolism. They planted
the lotus, and the monastery ponds became seats of splendor, and
delights to the eye. Their teachings, metaphysical and mystical,
poetical and historical, scientific and literary, created, it may
be said, the Japanese garden, which to the refined imagination
contains far more than meets the eye of the alien.<a id=
"footnotetag10-9" name="footnotetag10-9"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-9"><sup>9</sup></a> Indeed, the oriental imitations in
earth, stone, water and verdure, have a language and suggestion far
beyond what the usual parterres and walks, borders and lines,
fountains and statuary of a western garden teach. It may be said
that our "language of flowers" is more luxuriant and eloquent than
theirs; yet theirs is very rich also, besides being more subtle in
suggestion. The bonzes instilled doctrine, not only by sermons,
books and the emblems and furniture of the temples, but they also
taught dogma and ethics by the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page295" id="page295"></a>{295}</span> flower-ponds and plots, by
the artificial landscape, and by outdoor symbolism of all kinds. To
Buddhism our thanks are due, for the innumerable miniature
continents, ranges of mountains, geographical outlines and other
horticultural allusions to their holy lands and spiritual history,
seen beside so many houses, temples and monasteries in Japan. In
their floral art, no people excels the Japanese in making leaf and
bloom teach history, religion, philosophy, aesthetics and
patriotism.</p>
<p>Not only around the human habitation,<a id="footnotetag10-10"
name="footnotetag10-10"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-10"><sup>10</sup></a> but within it, the new religion
brought a marvellous change. Instead of the hut, the dwelling-house
grew to spacious and comfortable proportions, every part of the
Japanese house to-day showing to the cultured student, especially
to one familiar with the ancient poetry, the lines of its origin
and development, and in the larger dwellings expressing a wealth of
suggestion and meaning. The oratory and the kami-dana or shelf
holding the gods, became features in the humblest dwelling. Among
the well-to-do there were of course the gilded ancestral tablets
and the worship of progenitors, in special rooms, with imposing
ritual and equipment, with which Buddhism did not interfere; but on
the shelf over the door of nearly every house in the land, along
with the emblems of the kami, stood images representing the avatars
of Buddha.<a id="footnotetag10-11" name=
"footnotetag10-11"></a><a href="#footnote10-11"><sup>11</sup></a>
There, the light ever burned, and there, offerings of food and
drink were thrice daily made. Though the family worship might vary
in its length and variety of ceremony, yet even in the home where
no regular system was followed, the burning lights and the stated
offering made, called the mind up to thoughts higher than the mere
level of providing <span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id=
"page296"></a>{296}</span> for daily wants. The visitation of the
priests in time of sorrow, or of joy, or for friendly converse,
made religion sweetly human.<a id="footnotetag10-12" name=
"footnotetag10-12"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Outwardly the Buddhist architecture made a profound change in
the landscape. With a settled religion requiring gorgeous
ceremonial, the chanting of liturgies by large bodies of priests
and the formation of monasteries as centres of literary and
religious activity, there were required stability and permanence in
the imperial court itself. While, therefore, the humble village
temples arose all over the country, there were early erected, in
the place where the court and emperor dwelt, impressive religious
edifices.<a id="footnotetag10-13" name=
"footnotetag10-13"></a><a href="#footnote10-13"><sup>13</sup></a>
The custom of migration ceased, and a fixed spot selected as the
capital, remained such for a number of generations, until finally
H&eacute;ian-j[)o] or the place of peace, later called Ki[=o]to,
became the "Blossom Capital" and the Sacred City for a thousand
years. At Nara, where flourished the first six sects introduced
from Korea, were built vast monasteries, temples and images, and
thence the influence of civilisation and art radiated. From the
first, forgetting its primitive democracy and purely moral claims,
Buddhism lusted for power in the State. As early as A.D. 624,
various grades were assigned to the priesthood by the
government.<a id="footnotetag10-14" name=
"footnotetag10-14"></a><a href="#footnote10-14"><sup>14</sup></a>
The sects eagerly sought and laid great stress upon imperial favor.
To this day they keenly enjoy the canonization of their great
teachers by letters patent from the Throne.</p>
<h3>Ministers of Art.</h3>
<p>On the establishment of the imperial capital, at Ki[=o]to,
toward the end of the eighth century, we find <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>{297}</span> still
further development and enlargement of those latent artistic
impulses with which the Heavenly Father endowed his Japanese child.
That capacity for beauty, both in appreciation and expression,
which in our day makes the land of dainty decoration the resort of
all those who would study oriental art in unique fulness and
decorative art in its only living school&mdash;a school founded on
the harmonious marriage of the people and the nature of the
country&mdash;is discernible from quite early ages. The people seem
to have responded gladly to the calls for gifts and labor. The
direction from which it is supposed all evils are likely to come is
the northeast; this special point of the compass being in pan-Asian
spiritual geography the focus of all malign influences.
Accordingly, the Mikado Kwammu, in A.D. 788, built on the highest
mountain called Hiy&eacute;i a superb temple and monastery, giving
it in charge of the Ten-dai sect, that there should ever be a
bulwark against the evil that might otherwise swoop upon the city.
Here, as on castellated walls, should stand the watchman, who, by
the recitation of the sacred liturgies, would keep watch and ward.
In course of time this great mountain became a city of three
thousand edifices and ten thousand monks, from which the droning of
litanies and the chanting of prayers ascended daily, and where the
chief industries were, the counting of beads on rosaries and the
burning of incense before the altars. This was in the long bright
day of a prosperity which has been nourished by vast sums obtained
from the government and nobles. One notes the contrast at the end
of our century, when "disestablished" as a religion and its bonzes
reduced to beggary, Hiy&eacute;i-san <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page298" id="page298"></a>{298}</span> is used as the site of a
Summer School of Christian Theology.</p>
<p>Along with the blossoming of the lotus in every part of the
empire, bloomed the grander flowers of sculpture, of painting and
of temple architecture. It was because of the carpenter's craft in
building temples that he won his name of Dai-ku, or the great
workman. The artificers of the sunny islands cultivated an
ambition, not only to equal but to excel, their continental
brethren of the saw and hammer. Yet the carpenter was only the
leader of great hosts of artisans that were encouraged, of
craftsmen that were educated and of industries that were called
into being by the spread of Buddhism.<a id="footnotetag10-15" name=
"footnotetag10-15"></a><a href="#footnote10-15"><sup>15</sup></a>
It was not enough that village temples and town monasteries should
be built, under an impulse that meant volumes for the development
of the country. The ambitious leaders chose sightly spots on
mountains whence were lovely vistas of scenery, on which to erect
temples and monasteries, while it seemed to be their further
ambition to allow no mountain peak to be inaccessible. With armies
of workmen, supported by the contributions of the faithful who had
been aroused to enthusiasm by the preaching of the bonzes, great
swaths were cut in the forest; abundant timber was felled; rocky
plateaus were levelled; and elegant monastic edifices were reared,
soon to be filled with eager students, and young men in training
for the priesthood.</p>
<p>Whether the pilgrimage<a id="footnotetag10-16" name=
"footnotetag10-16"></a><a href="#footnote10-16"><sup>16</sup></a>
be of Shint[=o] or of Buddhist origin, or simply a contrivance of
human nature to break the monotony of life, we need not discuss. It
is certain that if the custom be indigenous, the imported faith
adopted, absorbed and enlarged it. The peregrinations <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>{299}</span> made to
the great temples and to the mountain tops, being meritorious
performances, soon filled the roads with more or less devout
travellers. In thus finding vent for their piety, the pilgrims
mingled sanctification with recreation, enjoying healthful
holidays, and creating trade with varied business, commercial and
commissarial activities, while enlarging also their ideas and
learning something of geography. Thus, in the course of time, it
has come to pass that Japan is a country of which almost every
square mile is known, while it is well threaded with paths, banded
with roads, and supplied to a remarkable extent with handy volumes
of description and of local history.<a id="footnotetag10-17" name=
"footnotetag10-17"></a><a href="#footnote10-17"><sup>17</sup></a>
Her people being well educated in their own lore and local
traditions, possessed also a voluminous literature of guidebooks
and cyclopedias of information. The devotees were, withal, well
instructed and versed in a code of politeness and courtesy, as
pilgrimage and travel became settled habits of a life. As a further
result, the national tongue became remarkably homogeneous. Broadly
speaking, it may be said that the Japanese language, unlike the
Chinese in this as it is in almost every other point, has very
little dialectic variation.<a id="footnotetag10-18" name=
"footnotetag10-18"></a><a href="#footnote10-18"><sup>18</sup></a>
Except in some few remote eddies lying outside the general
currents, there is a uniform national speech. This is largely owing
to that annual movement of pilgrims in the summer months
especially, habitual during many centuries.</p>
<p>Buddhism coming to Japan by means of the Great Vehicle, or with
the features of the Northern development, was the fertile mother of
art. In the exterior equipment of the temple, instead of the
Shint[=o] thatch, the tera or Buddhist edifice called for tiles on
its <span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id=
"page300"></a>{300}</span> sweeping roof, with ornamental
terra-cotta at the end of its imposing roof-ridge, or for sheets of
copper soon to be made verdant, then sombre and then sable by age
and atmosphere. Outwardly the edifice required the application of
paint and lacquer in rich tints, its recurved roof-edges gladly
welcoming the crest and monogram of the feudal prince, and its
railings and stairways accepting willingly the bronze caps and
ornaments. In front of its main edifice was the imposing gateway
with proportions almost as massive as the temple itself, with
prodigal wealth of curiously fitted and richly carved, painted and
gilded supports and morticings, with all the fancies and adornments
of the carpenter's art, and having as its frontlet and blazon the
splendidly gilt name, style or title. Often these were impressive
to eye and mind, to an extent which the terse Chinese or curt
monosyllables could scarcely suggest to an alien.<a id=
"footnotetag10-19" name="footnotetag10-19"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-19"><sup>19</sup></a> The number, forms and positions
of the various parts of the temple easily lent themselves to the
expression of the elaborate symbolism of the India faith.</p>
<h3>Resemblances between Buddhism and Christianity.</h3>
<p>Within the sacred edifice everything to strike the senses was
lavishly displayed. The passion of the East, as opposed to Greek
simplicity, is for decoration; yet in Japan, decorative art, though
sometimes bursting out in wild profusion or running to unbridled
lengths, was in the main a regulated mass of splendor in which
harmony ruled. Differing though the Buddhist sects do in their
temple furniture and altar decorations, they are, most of them, so
elaborately full in their equipment <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page301" id="page301"></a>{301}</span> as to suggest repeatedly
the similarity between the Roman Catholic organization, altars,
vestments and ritual, and those of Buddhism, and remarks on this
point seem almost commonplace. Almost everything in Roman
Catholicism is found in Buddhism,<a id="footnotetag10-20" name=
"footnotetag10-20"></a><a href="#footnote10-20"><sup>20</sup></a>
and one may even say, <i>vice versa</i>, at least in things
exterior. We take the liberty of transcribing here a passage from
the chapter entitled "Christianity and Foreigners" in The Mikado's
Empire, written twenty years ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Furthermore, the transition from the religion of India to that
of Rome was extremely easy. The very idols of Buddha served, after
a little alteration with the chisel, for images of Christ. The
Buddhist saints were easily transformed into the Twelve Apostles.
The Cross took the place of the <i>torii</i>. It was emblazoned on
the helmets and banners of the warriors, and embroidered on their
breasts. The Japanese soldiers went forth to battle like Christian
crusaders. In the roadside shrine Kuanon, the Goddess of Mercy,
made way for the Virgin, the mother of God. Buddhism was beaten
with its own weapons. Its own artillery was turned against it.
Nearly all the Christian churches were native temples, sprinkled
and purified. The same bell, whose boom had so often quivered the
air announcing the orisons and matins of paganism, was again
blessed and sprinkled, and called the same hearers to mass and
confession; the same lavatory that fronted the temple served for
holy water or baptismal font; the same censer that swung before
Amida could be refilled to waft Christian incense; the new convert
could use unchanged his old beads, bells, candles, incense, and all
the paraphernalia of his old faith in celebration of the new.</p>
<p>"Almost everything that is distinctive in the Roman form of
Christianity is to be found in Buddhism: images, pictures, lights,
altars, incense, vestments, masses, beads, wayside shrines,
monasteries, nunneries, celibacy, fastings, vigils, retreats,
pilgrimages, mendicant vows, shorn heads, orders, habits, uniforms,
nuns, convents, purgatory, saintly and priestly <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>{302}</span>
intercession, indulgences, works of supererogation, pope,
archbishops, abbots, abbesses, monks, neophytes, relics and
relic-worship, exclusive burial-ground, etc., etc., etc."<a id=
"footnotetag10-21" name="footnotetag10-21"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, these resemblances are almost wholly superficial,
and have little or nothing to do with genuine religion. Such
matters are of aesthetic and of commercial, rather than of
spiritual, interest. They concern priestcraft and vulgar
superstition rather than truth and righteousness. "In point of
dogma a whole world of thought separates Buddhism from every form
of Christianity. Knowledge, enlightenment, is the condition of
Buddhistic grace, not faith. Self-perfectionment is the means of
salvation, not the vicarious sufferings of a Redeemer. Not eternal
life is the end and active participation in unceasing prayer and
praise, but absorption into Nirvana (Jap. Nehan), practical
annihilation."<a id="footnotetag10-22" name=
"footnotetag10-22"></a><a href="#footnote10-22"><sup>22</sup></a>
At certain points, the metaphysic of Buddhism is so closely like
that of Christian theology, that a connection on reciprocal
exchange of ideas is not only possible but probable. In their
highest thinking,<a id="footnotetag10-23" name=
"footnotetag10-23"></a><a href="#footnote10-23"><sup>23</sup></a>
the sincere Christian and Buddhist approach each other in their
search after truth.</p>
<p>The key-word of Buddhism is Ingwa, which means law or fate, the
chain of cause and effect in which man is found, atheistic
"evolution applied to ethics," the grinding machinery of a universe
in which is no Creator-Father, no love, pity or heart. If the cry
of the human spirit has compelled the makers of Buddhist theology
to furnish a goddess of mercy, it is but one subordinate being
among many. If a boundlessly compassionate Amida is thought out, it
is an imaginary being. The symbol of Buddhism is the wheel of the
law, which revolves as mercilessly as ceaselessly.<a id=
"footnotetag10-24" name="footnotetag10-24"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id=
"page303"></a>{303}</span>
<p>The key-word of Christianity is love, and its message is grace.
Its symbol is the cross, and its sacrament the supper, in token of
the infinite love of the Father who wrote his revelation in a human
life. The resemblances between the religions of Gautama and of
Jesus, are purely superficial. They appear to the outward man. The
inward man cannot, even from Darien peaks of observation or in his
scrutiny <i>de profundis</i>, discover any vital or historical
connection between the two faiths, Christianity and Buddhism. In
his theology the Christian says God is all; but the Buddhist says
All is god. Buddhism says destroy the passions: Christianity says
control them. The Buddhist's watchword is Nirvana. The Christian's
is Eternal Life in Christ Jesus.<a id="footnotetag10-25" name=
"footnotetag10-25"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h3>The Temples and Their Symbolism.</h3>
<p>In the vast airy halls of a Buddhist temple one will often see
columns made of whole tree-trunks, sheeted with gold and supporting
massive ceilings which are empanelled and gorgeous with every hue
and tint known to the palette. Besides the coloring, carving and
gilding, the rich symbolism strikes the eye and touches the
imagination. It is a pleasing study for one familiar with the
background and world of Buddhism, to note their revelation and
expression in art, as well as to discern what the varying sects
accept or reject. There is the lotus, in leaf, bud, flower and
calyx;<a id="footnotetag10-26" name="footnotetag10-26"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-26"><sup>26</sup></a> the diamond in every form, real
and imaginary, with the vagra or emblem of conquest; while on the
altars, beside the central image, be it that of Shaka or of Amida,
are Bodhisattvas or Buddhas by brevet, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>{304}</span> beings in
every state of existence, as well as deities of many names and
forms. Abstract ideas and attributes are expressed in the art
language not only of Japan, Korea and China, but also in that of
India and even of Persia and Greece,<a id="footnotetag10-27" name=
"footnotetag10-27"></a><a href="#footnote10-27"><sup>27</sup></a>
until one wonders how an Aryan religion, like Buddhism, could have
so conquered and unified the many nations of Chinese Asia. He
wonders, indeed, until he remembers how it has itself been
transformed and changed in popular substance, from lofty
metaphysics and ethics into pantheism for the shorn, and into
polytheism for the unshorn.</p>
<p>Looking at early Japanese pictures with the eye of the
historian, as well as of the connoisseur of art, one will see that
the first real school of Japanese art was Buddhistic. The modern
school of pictorial art, named from the monkish phrase,
Ukioy&eacute;&mdash;pictures of the Passing World&mdash;is indeed
very interesting to the western student, because it seems to be
more in touch with the human nature of the whole world, as distinct
from what is local, Chinese, or sectarian. Yet, casting a glance
back of the mediaeval Kano, Chinese and Yamato-Tosa styles, he
finds that Buddhism gave Japan her first examples of and stimulus
to pictorial art.<a id="footnotetag10-28" name=
"footnotetag10-28"></a><a href="#footnote10-28"><sup>28</sup></a>
He sees further that instead of the monochrome of Chinese exotic
art, or the first rude attempts of the native pencil, Buddhism
began Japanese sculpture, carving and nearly every other form of
plastic or pictorial representation, in which are all the elements
of Northern Buddhism, as so lavishly represented, for example, in
that great sutra which is the book, <i>par excellence</i>, of
Japanese Buddhism, the Saddharma Pundarika.</p>
<p>Turning from text to art, we behold the golden lakes of joy, the
mountain of gems, the floating female angels <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>{305}</span> with
their marvellous drapery and lovely faces, the gentle benignity of
the goddesses of mercy, the rays of light and the glory streaming
from face and head of the holy ones, the splendors of costume, the
varied beauties of the lotus, the hosts of ministering
intelligences, the luxuriant symbolism, the purple clouds, the
wheel of the law, the swastika<a id="footnotetag10-29" name=
"footnotetag10-29"></a><a href="#footnote10-29"><sup>29</sup></a>
or double cross, and the vagra,<a id="footnotetag10-30" name=
"footnotetag10-30"></a><a href="#footnote10-30"><sup>30</sup></a>
or diamond trefoil. All that color, perfume, sensuous delights, art
and luxury can suggest, are here, together with all the various
orders of beings that inhabit the Buddhist universe; and these are
set forth in their fulness and detail. In the six conditions of
sentient existence are devas or gods, men, asuras or monsters,
pretas or demons, beasts, and beings in hell. In portraying these,
the artists and sculptors do not always slavishly follow tradition
or uniformity. The critical eye notes nearly as much genius, wit
and variety as in the mediaeval cathedral architecture of Europe.
Probably the most popular groups of idols are those of the seven or
the thirty-three Kuannon, of the six Jizo<a id="footnotetag10-31"
name="footnotetag10-31"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-31"><sup>31</sup></a> or compassionate helpers, and of
the sixteen or the five hundred Rakan<a id="footnotetag10-32" name=
"footnotetag10-32"></a><a href="#footnote10-32"><sup>32</sup></a>
or circles of primitive disciples of Gautama. The angelic beings
and sweetly singing birds of Paradise are also favorite subjects of
the artists.</p>
<p>One who has lived alongside the great temples; who knows the
daily routine and sees what powerful engines of popular instruction
they are; who has been present at the great festivals and looked
upon the mighty kitchens and refectories in operation; and who has
gone in and out among their monasteries and examined their records,
their genealogies and their relics, can see how powerfully Buddhism
has moulded the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id=
"page306"></a>{306}</span> whole life of the people through long
ages. The village temple is often the epitome and repository of the
social life of the people now living, and of the story of their
ancestors for generations upon generations past. It is the
historico-genealogical society, the museum, the repository of
documents and trophies, the place of national thanksgiving and
praise, of public sorrow and farewell, a place of rendezvous and
separation, the starting-point of procession, and the centre of
festival and joy; and thus it is linked with the life of the
people.</p>
<p>In other respects, also, the temple is like the old village
cathedral of mediaeval Europe. It is in many sects the centre of
popular pleasure of all sorts, both reputable and disreputable. Not
only shops and bazaars, fairs and markets, games and sports,
cluster around it, but also curiosities and works of popular art,
the relics of war, and the trophies of travel and adventure. Except
that Buddhism&mdash;outside of India&mdash;never had the unity of
European Christianity, the Buddhist temple is the mirror and
encyclopaedia both of history and of contemporary life. As fame and
renown are necessary for the glory of the place or the structure,
favorite gods, or rather their idols, are frequently carried about
on "starring" tours. At the opening to public view of some famous
image or relic, a great festival or revival called Kai-ch[=o] is
held, which becomes a scene of trade and merry-making like that of
the mediaeval fair or kermis in Europe. The far-oriental is able as
skilfully as his western confr&egrave;re, to mix business and
religion and to suppose that gain is godliness. Further, the
manufacture of legend becomes a thriving industry; while the
not-infrequent sensation of a popular miracle <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>{307}</span> is
manipulated by the bonzes&mdash;for priestcraft in all ages and
climes is akin throughout the world. It is no wonder that some
honest Japanese, incensed at the shams utilized by the religious,
has struck out like coin the proverb that rings true&mdash;"Good
doctrine needs no miracle."</p>
<h3>The Bell and the Cemetery.</h3>
<p>The Buddhist missionaries, and especially the founders of
temples, thoroughly understood the power of natural beauty to
humble, inspire and soothe the soul of man. The instinctive love of
the Japanese people for fine scenery, was made an ally of faith.
The sites for temples were chosen with reference to their imposing
surroundings or impressive vistas. Whether as spark-arresters and
protectives against fire, or to compel reverent awe, the loftiest
evergreen trees are planted around the sacred structure. These
"trees of Jehovah" are compellers to reverence. The <i>alien's</i>
hat comes off instinctively&mdash;though it may be less convenient
to shed boots than sandals&mdash;as he enters the sacred
structure.</p>
<p>The great tongueless bell is another striking accessory to the
temple services. Near at hand stands the belfry out of which boom
forth tidings of the hours. In the flow of time and years, the note
of the bell becomes more significant, and in old age solemn, making
in the lapse of centuries an educating power in seriousness. "As
sad as a temple bell" is the coinage of popular speech. Many of the
inscriptions, though with less of sunny hope and joy than even
Christian grave-stones bear, are yet mournfully beautiful.<a id=
"footnotetag10-33" name="footnotetag10-33"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-33"><sup>33</sup></a> They preach Buddhism in its
reality. Whereas, the general <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page308" id="page308"></a>{308}</span> associations of the
Christian spire and belfry, apart from the note of time, are those
of joy, invitation and good news, those of the tongueless and
log-struck bells of Buddhism are sombre and saddening. "As merry as
a marriage bell," could never be said of the boom from a Buddhist
temple, even though it pour waves of sound through sunny leagues.
There is a vast difference between the peal and play of the chimes
of Europe and the liquid melody which floods the landscape of
Chinese Asia. The one music, high in air, seems ever to tell of
faith, triumph and aspiration; the other in minor notes, from bells
hung low on yokes, perpetually echoes the pessimism of despair, the
folly of living and the joy that anticipates its end.</p>
<p>Above all, the temple holds and governs the cemetery<a id=
"footnotetag10-34" name="footnotetag10-34"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-34"><sup>34</sup></a> as well as the cradle; while
from it emanate influences that enwrap and surround the villager,
from birth to death. Since the outlawry of Christianity, and
especially since the division of the empire into Buddhist parishes,
the bonzes have had the oversight of birth, death, marriage and
divorce. Particularly tenacious, in common with priestcraft all
over the world, is their clutch upon what they call "consecrated
ground." In a large sense Japan is still, what China has always
been, a country governed by the graveyard. These cities of the dead
are usually kept in attractive order and made beautiful with
flowers in memoriam. The study of epitaphs and mortuary
architecture, though not without elements bordering on the
ludicrous, is enjoyed by the thoughtful student.<a id=
"footnotetag10-35" name="footnotetag10-35"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In every community the inhabitants are enrolled at birth at the
local temple, whose priests are the authorized religious teachers,
and are always expected to take charge of the funerals <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>{309}</span> of those
whose names are thus enrolled. So long as an individual remains in
the region of the family temple, the tie which binds him to it is
exceedingly difficult to break; but if he moves away he is no
longer bound by this tie. This explains the fact, so often observed
by missionaries, that the membership of Christian churches is made
up almost entirely of people who have come from other localities.
In the city of Osaka, for instance, it is a very rare thing to find
a native Osakan in any of the churches. The same is true in all
parts of the country. So long as a Japanese remains in the
neighborhood of his family temple it is almost impossible to get
him to break the temple tie and join a Christian church; but when
he moves to another place he is free to do as he likes.<a id=
"footnotetag10-36" name="footnotetag10-36"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement of a resident in modern Japan will long remain
true for a large part of the empire.</p>
<h3>Political and Military Influences.</h3>
<p>A volume might be written and devoted to Japanese Buddhism as a
political power; for, having quickly obtained intellectual
possession of the court and emperor, it dictated the policies of
the rulers. In A.D. 624, it was recognized as a state religion, and
the hierarchy of priests was officially established. At this date
there were 46 temples and monasteries, with 816 monks and 569 nuns.
As early as the eighth century, beginning with Sh[=o]mu, who
reigned A.D. 724-728, and who with his daughter, afterward the
female Mikado, became a disciple of Shaka, the habit of the
emperors becoming monks, shaving their heads and retiring from
public life, came in vogue and lasted until near the nineteenth
century. By this means the bonzes were soon enabled to call
Buddhism "the people's religion," and to secure the resources of
the national treasury as <span class="pagenum"><a name="page310"
id="page310"></a>{310}</span> an aid to their temple and monastery
building, and for the erection of those images and wayside shrines
on which so many millions of dollars have been lavished. In
addition to this subsidized propaganda, the Buddhist confessor was
too often able, by means of the wife, concubine, or other female
member of the household, imperial or noble, to dictate the imperial
policy in accordance with monkish or priestly ideas. Ug&eacute;no
D[=o]-ki[=o], a monk, is believed to have aspired to the throne.
Being made premier by the Empress K[=o]-ken, whose passion for him
is the scandal of history, he made no scruple of extending the
power as well as the influence of the Buddhist hierarchy.</p>
<p>Buddhism had also a distinct influence on the military history
of the country,<a id="footnotetag10-37" name=
"footnotetag10-37"></a><a href="#footnote10-37"><sup>37</sup></a>
and this was greatest during the civil wars of the rival Mikados
(1336-1392), when the whole country was a camp and two lines of
nominees claimed to be descendants of the sun-goddess. Japan's only
foreign wars have been in the neighboring peninsula of Korea, and
thither the bonzes went with the armies in the expeditions of the
early centuries, and in that great invasion of 1592-1597, which has
left a scar even to this day on the Korean mind. At home, Buddhist
priests only too gladly accompanied the imperial armies of conquest
and occupation. During centuries of activity in the southwest and
in the far east and extreme north, the military brought the
outlying portions of the empire, throughout the whole archipelago,
under the sway of the Yamato tribe and the Mikado's dominion. The
shorn clerks not only lived in camp, ministered to the sick and
shrived the dying soldier, but wrote texts for the banners,
furnished the amulets <span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id=
"page311"></a>{311}</span> and war cries, and were ever assistant
and valuable in keeping up the temper and morals of the
armies.<a id="footnotetag10-38" name=
"footnotetag10-38"></a><a href="#footnote10-38"><sup>38</sup></a>
No sooner was the campaign over and peace had become the order of
the day, than the enthusiastic missionaries began to preach and to
teach in the pacified region. They set up the shrines, anon started
the school and built the temple; usually, indeed, with the aid of
the law and the government, acting as agents of a
politico-ecclesiastical establishment, yet with energy and
consecration.</p>
<p>In later feudal days, when the soldier classes obtained the
upper hand, overawed the court and Mikado and gradually supplanted
the civil authority, introducing feudalism and martial law, the
bonzes often represented the popular and democratic side.
Protesting against arbitrary government, they came into collision
with the warrior rulers, so as to be exposed to imprisonment and
the sword. Yet even as refugees and as men to whom the old seats of
activity no longer offered success or comfort, they went off into
the distant and outlying provinces, preaching the old tenets and
the new fashions in theology. Thus again they won hosts of
converts, built monasteries, opened fresh paths and were purveyors
of civilization.</p>
<p>The feudal ages in Japan bred the same type of militant priest
known in Europe&mdash;the military bishop and the soldier monk. So
far from Japan's being the "Land of Great Peace," and Buddhism's
being necessarily gentle and non-resistant, we find in the
chequered history of the island empire many a bloody battle between
the monks on horseback and in armor.<a id="footnotetag10-39" name=
"footnotetag10-39"></a><a href="#footnote10-39"><sup>39</sup></a>
Rival sectarians kept the country disquieted for years. Between
themselves and their favored laymen, and the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>{312}</span> enemy,
consisting of the rival forces, lay and clerical, in like array,
many a bloody battle was fought.</p>
<p>The writer lived for one year in Echizen, which, in the
fifteenth century, was the battle-ground for over fifty years, of
warring monks. The abbot of the Monastery of the Original Vow, of
the Shin sect, in Ki[=o]to, had built before the main edifice a
two-storied gate, which was expected to throw into the shade every
other gateway in Japan, and especially to humble the pride of the
monks of the Tendai sect, in Hiy&eacute;izan, The monks of the
mountain, swarming down into the capital city, attacked the gate
and monastery of the Shin sect and burned the former to ashes. The
abbot thus driven off by fire, fled northward, and, joined by a
powerful body of adherents, made himself possessor of the rich
provinces of Kaga and Echizen, holding this region for half a
century, until able to rebuild the mighty fortress-monasteries near
Ki[=o]to and at Osaka.</p>
<p>These strongholds of the fighting Shin priests had become so
powerful as arsenals and military headquarters, that in 1570,
Nobunaga, skilful general as he was, and backed by sixty thousand
men, was unsuccessful in his attempt to reduce them. For ten years,
the war between Nobunaga and the Shin sectarians kept the country
in disorder. It finally ended in the conflagration of the great
religious fortress at Osaka, and the retreat of the monks to
another part of the country. By their treachery and incendiarism,
the shavelings prevented the soldiers from enjoying the prizes.</p>
<p>To detail the whole history of the fighting monks would be
tedious. They have had a foothold for many centuries and even to
the present time, in every province except that of Satsuma. There,
because they <span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id=
"page313"></a>{313}</span> treacherously aided the great
Hid&eacute;yoshi to subdue the province, the fiery clansmen, never
during Tokugawa days, permitted a Buddhist priest to come.<a id=
"footnotetag10-40" name="footnotetag10-40"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h3>Literature, and Education.</h3>
<p>In its literary and scholastic development, Japanese Buddhism on
its popular educational side deserves great praise. Although the
Buddhist canon<a id="footnotetag10-41" name=
"footnotetag10-41"></a><a href="#footnote10-41"><sup>41</sup></a>
was never translated into the vernacular,<a id="footnotetag10-42"
name="footnotetag10-42"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-42"><sup>42</sup></a> and while the library of native
Buddhism, in the way of commentary or general literature, reflects
no special credit upon the priests, yet the historian must award
them high honor, because of the part taken by them as educators and
schoolmasters.<a id="footnotetag10-43" name=
"footnotetag10-43"></a><a href="#footnote10-43"><sup>43</sup></a>
Education in ancient and mediaeval times was, among the laymen,
confined almost wholly to the imperial court, and was considered
chiefly to be, either as an adjunct to polite accomplishments, or
as valuable especially in preparing young men for political
office.<a id="footnotetag10-44" name=
"footnotetag10-44"></a><a href="#footnote10-44"><sup>44</sup></a>
From the first introduction of letters until well into the
nineteenth century, there was no special provision for education
made by the government, except that, in modern and recent times in
the castle towns of the Daimi[=o]s, there were schools of Chinese
learning for the Samurai. Private schools and school-masters<a id=
"footnotetag10-45" name="footnotetag10-45"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-45"><sup>45</sup></a> were also creditably numerous.
In original literature, poetry, fiction and history, as well as in
the humbler works of compilation, in the making of text-books and
in descriptive lore, the pens of many priests have been busy.<a id=
"footnotetag10-46" name="footnotetag10-46"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-46"><sup>46</sup></a> The earliest biography written
in Japan was of Sh[=o]toku, the great lay patron of Buddhism. In
the ages of war the monastery was the ark of preservation amid a
flood of desolation.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id=
"page314"></a>{314}</span>
<p>The temple schools were early established, and in the course of
centuries became at times almost coextensive with the empire.
Besides the training of the neophytes in the Chinese language and
the vernacular, there were connected with thousands of temples,
schools in which the children, not only of the well-to-do, but
largely of the people, were taught the rudiments of education,
chiefly reading and writing. Most of the libraries of the country
were those in monasteries. Although it is not probable that
K[=o]b[=o] invented the Kana or common script, yet it is reasonably
certain that the bonzes<a id="footnotetag10-47" name=
"footnotetag10-47"></a><a href="#footnote10-47"><sup>47</sup></a>
were the chief instrument in the diffusion and popularization of
that simple system of writing, which made it possible to carry
literature down into the homes of the merchant and peasant, and
enabled even women and children to beguile the tedium of their
lives. Thus the people expanded their thoughts through the medium
of the written, and later of the printed, page.<a id=
"footnotetag10-48" name="footnotetag10-48"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-48"><sup>48</sup></a> Until modern centuries, when the
school of painters, which culminated in Hok[)u]sai and his
contemporaries, brought a love of art down to the lowest classes of
the people, the only teacher of pictorial and sculptural art for
the multitude, was Buddhism. So strong is this popular delight in
things artistic that probably, to this passion as much as to the
religious instinct, we owe many of the wayside shrines and images,
the symbolical and beautifully prepared landscapes, and those stone
stairways which slope upward toward the shrines on the hill-tops.
In Japan, art is not a foreign language; it is vernacular.</p>
<p>Thus, while we gladly point out how Buddhism, along the paths of
exploration, commerce, invention, sociology, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>{315}</span> military
and political influence, education and literature, not only
propagated religion, but civilized Japan,<a id="footnotetag10-49"
name="footnotetag10-49"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-49"><sup>49</sup></a> it is but in the interest of
fairness and truth that we point out that wherein the great system
was deficient. If we make comparison with Christendom and the
religion of Jesus, it is less with the purpose of the polemic who
must perhaps necessarily disparage, and more with the idea of
making contrast between what we have seen in Japan and what we have
enjoyed as commonplace in the United States and Europe.</p>
<h3>Things Which Buddhism Left Undone.</h3>
<p>In the thirteen hundred years of the life of Buddhism in Japan,
what are the fruits, and what are the failures? Despite its
incessant and multifarious activities, one looks in vain for the
hospital, the orphan asylum, the home for elderly men or women or
aged couples, or the asylum for the insane, and much less, for that
vast and complicated system of organized charities, which, even
amid our material greed of gain, make cities like New York, or
London, or Chicago, so beautiful from the point of view of
humanity. Buddhism did indeed teach kindness to animals, making
even the dog, though ownerless and outcast, in a sense sacred.
Because of his faith in the doctrine of the transmigration of
souls, the toiling laborer will keep his wheels or his feet from
harming the cat or dog or chicken in the road, even though it be at
risk and trouble and with added labor to himself. The pious will
buy the live birds or eels from the old woman who sits on the
bridge, in order to give them life and liberty again in air or
water. The sacred <span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id=
"page316"></a>{316}</span> rice is for sale at the temples, not
only to feed but to fatten the holy pigeons.</p>
<p>Yet, while all this care is lavished on animals, the human being
suffers.<a id="footnotetag10-50" name=
"footnotetag10-50"></a><a href="#footnote10-50"><sup>50</sup></a>
Buddhism is kind to the brute, and cruel to man. Until the influx
of western ideas in recent years, the hospital and the orphanage
did not exist in Japan, despite the gentleness and tenderness of
Shaka, who, with all his merits, deserted his wife and babe in
order to enlighten mankind.<a id="footnotetag10-51" name=
"footnotetag10-51"></a><a href="#footnote10-51"><sup>51</sup></a>
If Buddhism is not directly responsible for the existence of that
class of Japanese pariahs called <i>hi-nin</i>, or not-human, the
name and the idea are borrowed from the sutras; while the
execration of all who prepare or sell the flesh of animals is
persistently taught in the sacred books. These unfortunate bearers
of the human image, during twelve hundred years and until the fiat
of the present illustrious emperor made them citizens, were not
reckoned in the census, nor was the land on which they dwelt
measured. The imperial edict which finally elevated the Eta to
citizenship, was suggested by one whose life, though known to men
as that of a Confucian, was probably hid with Christ, Yokoi
H&eacute;ishiro.<a id="footnotetag10-52" name=
"footnotetag10-52"></a><a href="#footnote10-52"><sup>52</sup></a>
The emperor Mutsuhito, 123d of the line of Japan, born on the day
when Perry was on the Mississippi and ready to sail, placed over
these outcast people in 1871, the protecting aegis of the
law.<a id="footnotetag10-53" name="footnotetag10-53"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-53"><sup>53</sup></a> Until that time, the people in
this unfortunate class, numbering probably a million, or, as some
say, three millions, were compelled to live outside of the limits
of human habitation, having no lights which society or the law was
bound to respect. They were given food or drink only when
benevolence might be roused; but the donor would never again touch
the vessel in which the offering was <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page317" id="page317"></a>{317}</span> made. The Eta,<a id=
"footnotetag10-54" name="footnotetag10-54"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-54"><sup>54</sup></a> though in individual cases
becoming measurably rich, rotted and starved, and were made the
filth, and off-scouring of the earth, because they were the
butchers, the skinners, the leather workers, and thus handled dead
animals, being made also the executioners and buriers of the dead.
After a quarter of a century the citizens, whose ancestry is not
forgotten, suffer social ostracism even more than do the freed
slaves of our country, though between them and the other Japanese
there is no color line, but only the streak of difference which
Buddhism created and has maintained. Nevertheless, let it be said
to the eternal honor of Shin Shu and of some of the minor sects,
that they were always kind and helpful to the Eta.</p>
<p>Furthermore it would be hard to discover Buddhist missionary
activities among the Ainos, or benefits conferred upon them by the
disciples of Gautama. One would suppose that the Buddhists,
professing to be believers in spiritual democracy, would be equally
active among all sorts and conditions of men; but they have not
been so. Even in the days when the regions of the Ebisu or
barbarians (Yezo) extended far southward upon the main island, the
missionary bonze was conspicuous by his absence among these people.
It would seem as though the popular notion that the Ainos are the
offspring of dogs, had been fed by prejudices inculcated by
Buddhism. It has been reserved for Christian aliens to reduce the
language of these simple savages to writing, and to express in it
for their spiritual benefit the ideas and literature of a religion
higher than their own, as well as to erect church edifices and
build hospitals.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id=
"page318"></a>{318}</span>
<h3>The Attitude Toward Woman.</h3>
<p>In its attitude toward woman, which is perhaps one of the
crucial tests of a religion as well as of a civilization, Buddhism
has somewhat to be praised and much to be blamed for. It is
probable that the Japanese woman owes more to Buddhism than to
Confucianism, though relatively her position was highest under
Shint[=o]. In Japan the women are the freest in Asia, and probably
the best treated among any Asiatic nation, but this is not because
of Gautama's teaching.<a id="footnotetag10-55" name=
"footnotetag10-55"></a><a href="#footnote10-55"><sup>55</sup></a>
Very early in its history Japanese Buddhism welcomed womanhood to
its fraternity and order,<a id="footnotetag10-56" name=
"footnotetag10-56"></a><a href="#footnote10-56"><sup>56</sup></a>
yet the Japanese <i>ama, bikuni</i>, or nun, never became a sister
of mercy, or reached, even within a measurable distance, the
dignity of the Christian lady in the nunnery. In European history
the abbess is a notable figure. She is hardly heard of beyond the
Japanese nunnery, even by the native scholar&mdash;except in
fiction.</p>
<p>So far as we can see, the religion founded by one who deserted
his wife and babe did nothing to check concubinage or polygamy. It
simply allowed these things, or ameliorated their ancient barbaric
conditions through the law of kindness. Nevertheless, it brought
education and culture within the family as well as within the
court. It would be an interesting question to discuss how far the
age of classic vernacular prose or the early mediaeval literature
of romance, which is almost wholly the creation of woman,<a id=
"footnotetag10-57" name="footnotetag10-57"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-57"><sup>57</sup></a> is due to Buddhism, or how far
the credit belongs, by induction or reaction, to the Chinese
movement in favor of learning. Certainly, the faith of India
touches and feeds <span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id=
"page319"></a>{319}</span> the imagination far more than does that
of China. Certainly also, the animating spirit of most of the
popular literature is due to Buddhistic culture. The Shin sect,
which permits the marriage of the priests and preaches the
salvation of woman, probably leads all others in according honor to
her as well as in elevating her social position.</p>
<p>Buddhism, like Roman Catholicism, and as compared to
Confucianism which is protestant and masculine, is feminine in its
type. In Japan the place of the holy Virgin Mary is taken by
Kuannon, the goddess of mercy; and her shrine is one of the most
popular of all. Much the same may be said of Benten, the queen of
the heaven and mistress of the seas. The angels of Buddhism are
always feminine, and, as in the unscriptural and pagan conception
of Christian angels, have wings.<a id="footnotetag10-58" name=
"footnotetag10-58"></a><a href="#footnote10-58"><sup>58</sup></a>
So also in the legends of Gautama, in the Buddhist lives of the
saints, and in legendary lore as well as in glyptic and pictorial
art, the female being transfigured in loveliness is a striking
figure. Nevertheless, after all is summed up that can possibly be
said in favor of Buddhism, the position it accords to woman is not
only immeasurably beneath that given by Christianity, but is below
that conceded by Shint[=o], which knows not only goddesses and
heroines, but also priestesses and empresses.<a id=
"footnotetag10-59" name="footnotetag10-59"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>According to the popular ethical view as photographed in
language, literature and art, jealousy is always represented by a
female demon. Indeed, most of the tempters, devils, and
transformations of humanity into malign beings, whether pretas,
asuras, oni, foxes, badgers, or cats, are females. As the Chinese
ideographs associate all things weak or vile with women,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id=
"page320"></a>{320}</span> so the tell-tale words of Japanese daily
speech are but reflections of the dogmas coined in the Buddhist
mint. In Japanese, chastity means not moral cleanliness without
regard to sex, but only womanly duties. For, while the man is
allowed a loose foot, the woman is expected not only to be
absolutely spotless, but also never to show any jealousy, however
wide the husband may roam, or however numerous may be the
concubines in his family. In a word, there is the double standard
of morals, not only of priest and laity, but of man and woman. The
position of the Japanese woman even of to-day, despite that
eagerness once shown to educate her&mdash;an eagerness which soon
cooled in the government schools, but which keeps an even pulse in
the Christian home and college&mdash;is still relatively one of
degradation as compared with that of her sister in Christendom. For
this, the mid-Asian religion is not wholly responsible, yet it is
largely so.</p>
<h3>Influence on the Japanese Character.</h3>
<p>In regard to the influence of Buddhism upon the morals and
character of the Japanese, there is much to be said in praise, and
much also in criticism. It has aided powerfully to educate the
people in habits of gentleness and courtesy, but instead of
aspiration and expectancy of improvement, it has given to them that
spirit of hopeless resignation which is so characteristic of the
Japanese masses. Buddhism has so dominated common popular
literature, daily life and speech, that all their mental procedure
and their utterance is cast in the moulds of Buddhist doctrine. The
fatalism of the Moslem world expressed in the idea of Kismet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id=
"page321"></a>{321}</span> has its analogue in the Japanese Ingwa,
or "cause and effect,"&mdash;the notion of an evolution which is
atheistic, but viewed from the ethical side. This idea of Ingwa is
the key to most Japanese novels as well as dramas of real
life.<a id="footnotetag10-60" name="footnotetag10-60"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-60"><sup>60</sup></a> While Buddhism continually
preaches this doctrine of Karma or Ingwa,<a id="footnotetag10-61"
name="footnotetag10-61"></a><a href=
"#footnote10-61"><sup>61</sup></a> the law of cause and effect, as
being sufficient to explain all things, it shows its insufficiency
and emptiness by leaving out the great First Cause of all. In a
word, Buddhism is law, but not gospel. It deals much with man, but
not with man's relations with his Creator, whom it utterly ignores.
Christianity comes not to destroy its ethics, beautiful as they
are, nor to ignore its metaphysics; but to fulfil, to give a higher
truth, and to reveal a larger Universe and One who fills it
all&mdash;not only law, but a Law-giver.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI - A CENTURY OF ROMAN CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<h3>Darkest Japan.</h3>
<p>The story of the first introduction and propagation of Roman
Christianity in Japan, during the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, has been told by many writers, both old and new, and in
many languages. Recent research upon the soil,<a id=
"footnotetag11-1" name="footnotetag11-1"></a><a href=
"#footnote11-1"><sup>1</sup></a> both natives and foreigners making
contributions, has illustrated the subject afresh. Relics and
memorials found in various churches, monasteries and palaces, on
both sides of the Pacific and the Atlantic, have cast new light
upon the fascinating theme. Both Christian and non-Christian
Japanese of to-day, in their travels in the Philippines, China,
Formosa, Mexico, Spain, Portugal and Italy, being keenly alert for
memorials of their countrymen, have met with interesting trovers.
The descendants of the Japanese martyrs and confessors now
recognize their own ancestors, in the picture galleries of Italian
nobles, and in Christian churches see lettered tombs bearing
familiar names, or in western museums discern far-eastern works of
art brought over as presents or curiosities, centuries ago.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, Japanese Christianity lasted phenomenally
nearly a century, or more exactly from 1542 to 1637, During this
time, embassies or missions <span class="pagenum"><a name="page326"
id="page326"></a>{326}</span> crossed the seas not only of Chinese
and Peninsular Asia, circumnavigating Africa and thus reaching
Europe, but also sailed across the Pacific, and visited papal
Christendom by way of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>This century of Southern Christianity and of commerce with
Europe enabled Japan, which had previously been almost unheard of,
except through the vague accounts of Marco Polo and the
semi-mythical stories by way of China, to leave a conspicuous mark,
first upon the countries of southern Europe, and later upon Holland
and England. As in European literature Cathay became China, and
Zipango or Xipangu was recognized as Japan, so also the
curiosities, the artistic fabrics, the strange things from the ends
of the earth, soon became familiar in Europe. Besides the traffic
in mercantile commodities, there were exchanges of words. The
languages of Europe were enriched by Japanese terms, such as soy,
moxa, goban, japan (lacquer or varnish), etc., while the tongue of
Nippon received an infusion of new terms,<a id="footnotetag11-2"
name="footnotetag11-2"></a><a href="#footnote11-2"><sup>2</sup></a>
and a notable list of inventions was imported from Europe.</p>
<p>We shall merely outline, with critical commentary, the facts of
history which have been so often told, but which in our day have
received luminous illustration. We shall endeavor to treat the
general phenomena, causes and results of Christianity in Japan in
the same judicial spirit with which we have considered
Buddhism.</p>
<p>Whatever be the theological or political opinions of the
observer who looks into the history of Japan at about the year
1540, he will acknowledge that this point of time was a very dark
moment in her known <span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id=
"page327"></a>{327}</span> history. Columbus, who was familiar with
the descriptions of Marco Polo, steered his caravels westward with
the idea of finding Xipangu, with its abundance of gold and
precious gems; but the Genoese did not and could not know the real
state of affairs existing in Dai Nippon at this time. Let us glance
at this.</p>
<p>The duarchy of Throne and Camp, with the Mikado in Ki[=o]to and
the Sh[=o]gun at Kamakura, with the elaborate feudalism under it,
had fallen into decay. The whole country was split up into a
thousand warring fragments. To these convulsions of society, in
which only the priest and the soldier were in comfort, while the
mass of the people were little better than serfs, must be added the
frequent violent earthquakes, drought and failure of crops, with
famine and pestilence. There was little in religion to uplift and
cheer. Shint[=o] had sunk into the shadow of a myth. Buddhism had
become outwardly a system of political gambling rather than the
ordered expression of faith. Large numbers of the priests were like
the mercenaries of Italy, who sold their influence and even their
swords or those of their followers, to the highest bidder. Besides
being themselves luxurious and dissolute, their monasteries were
fortresses, in which only the great political gamblers, and not the
oppressed people, found comfort and help. Millions of once fertile
acres had been abandoned or left waste. The destruction of
libraries, books and records is something awful to contemplate; and
"the times of Ashikaga" make a wilderness for the scapegoat of
chronology. Ki[=o]to, the sacred capital, had been again and again
plundered and burnt. Those who might be tempted to live in the city
amid the ruins, ran the risk of fire, murder, or <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>{328}</span>
starvation. Kamakura, once the Sh[=o]-gun's seat of authority, was,
a level waste of ashes.</p>
<p>Even China, Annam and Korea suffered from the practical
dissolution of society in the island empire; for Japanese pirates
ravaged their coasts to steal, burn and kill. Even as for centuries
in Europe, Christian churches echoed with that prayer in the
litanies: "From the fury of the Norsemen, good Lord, deliver us,"
so, along large parts of the deserted coasts of Chinese Asia, the
wretched inhabitants besought their gods to avenge them against the
"Wojen." To this day in parts of Honan in China, mothers frighten
their children and warn them to sleep by the fearful words "The
Japanese are coming."</p>
<h3>First Coming of Europeans.</h3>
<p>This time, then, was that of darkest Japan. Yet the people who
lived in darkness saw great light, and to them that dwelt in the
shadow of death, light sprang up.</p>
<p>When Pope Alexander VI. bisected the known world, assigning the
western half, including America to Spain, and the eastern half,
including Asia and its outlying archipelagos to the Portuguese, the
latter sailed and fought their way around Africa to India, and past
the golden Chersonese. In 1542, exactly fifty years after the
discovery of America, Dai Nippon was reached. Mendez Pinto, on a
Chinese pirate junk which had been driven by a storm away from her
companions, set foot upon an island called Tan&eacute;gashima. This
name among the country folks is still synonymous with guns and
pistols, for Pinto introduced fire-arms, and powder.<a id=
"footnotetag11-3" name="footnotetag11-3"></a><a href=
"#footnote11-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id=
"page329"></a>{329}</span>
<p>During six months spent by the "mendacious" Pinto on the island,
the imitative people made no fewer than six hundred match-locks or
arquebuses. Clearing twelve hundred per cent. on their cargo, the
three Portuguese loaded with presents, returned to China. Their
countrymen quickly flocked to this new market, and soon the
beginnings of regular trade with Portugal were inaugurated. On the
other hand, Japanese began to be found as far west as India. To
Malacca, while Francis Xavier was laboring there, came a refugee
Japanese, named Anjiro. The disciple of Loyola, and this child of
the Land of the Rising Sun met. Xavier, ever restless and ready for
a new field, was fired with the idea of converting Japan. Anjiro,
after learning Portuguese and becoming a Christian, was baptized
with the name of Paul. The heroic missionary of the cross and keys
then sailed with his Japanese companion, and in 1549 landed at
Kagoshima,<a id="footnotetag11-4" name=
"footnotetag11-4"></a><a href="#footnote11-4"><sup>4</sup></a> the
capital of Satsuma. As there was no central government then
existing in Japan, the entrance of the foreigners, both lay and
clerical, was unnoticed.</p>
<p>Having no skill in the learning of languages, and never able to
master one foreign tongue completely, Xavier began work with the
aid of an interpreter. The jealousy of the daimi[=o], because his
rivals had been supplied with fire-arms by the Portuguese
merchants, and the plots and warnings of those Buddhist priests
(who were later crushed by the Satsuma clansmen as traitors),
compelled Xavier to leave this province. He went first to
Hirado,<a id="footnotetag11-5" name="footnotetag11-5"></a><a href=
"#footnote11-5"><sup>5</sup></a> next to Nagat[=o], and then to
Bungo, where he was well received. Preaching and teaching through
his Japanese interpreter, he formed Christian congregations,
especially at Yamaguchi.<a id="footnotetag11-6" name=
"footnotetag11-6"></a><a href="#footnote11-6"><sup>6</sup></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id=
"page330"></a>{330}</span> Thus, within a year, the great apostle
to the Indies had seen the quick sprouting of the seed which he had
planted. His ambition was now to go to the imperial capital,
Ki[=o]to, and there advocate the claims of Christ, of Mary and of
the Pope.</p>
<p>Thus far, however, Xavier had seen only a few seaports of
comparatively successful daimi[=o]s. Though he had heard of the
unsettled state of the country because of the long-continued
intestine strife, he evidently expected to find the capital a
splendid city. Despite the armed bands of roving robbers and
soldiers, he reached Ki[=o]to safely, only to find streets covered
with ruins, rubbish and unburied corpses, and a general situation
of wretchedness. He was unable to obtain audience of either the
Sh[=o]gun or the Mikado. Even in those parts of the city where he
tried to preach, he could obtain no hearers in this time of war and
confusion. So after two weeks he turned his face again southward to
Bungo, where he labored for a few months; but in less than two
years from his landing in Japan, this noble but restless missionary
left the country, to attempt the spiritual conquest of China. One
year later, December 2, 1551, he died on the island of Shanshan, or
Sancian, in the Canton River, a few miles west of Macao.</p>
<h3>Christianity Flourishes.</h3>
<p>Nevertheless, Xavier's inspiring example was like a shining star
that attracted scores of missionaries. There being in this time of
political anarchy and religious paralysis none to oppose them,
their zeal, within five years, bore surprising fruits. They wrote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id=
"page331"></a>{331}</span> home that there were seven churches in
the region around Ki[=o]to, while a score or more of Christian
congregations had been gathered in the southwest. In 1581 there
were two hundred churches and one hundred and fifty thousand native
Christians. Two daimi[=o]s had confessed their faith, and in the
Mikado's minister, Nobunaga (1534-1582), the foreign priests found
a powerful supporter.<a id="footnotetag11-7" name=
"footnotetag11-7"></a><a href="#footnote11-7"><sup>7</sup></a> This
hater and scourge of the Buddhist priesthood openly welcomed and
patronized the Christians, and gave them eligible sites on which to
build dwellings and churches. In every possible way he employed the
new force, which he found pliantly political, as well as
intellectually and morally a choice weapon for humbling the bonzes,
whom he hated as serpents. The Buddhist church militant had become
an army with banners and fortresses. Nobunaga made it the aim of
his life to destroy the military power of the hierarchy, and to
humble the priests for all time. He hoped at least to extract the
fangs of what he believed to be a politico-religious monster, which
menaced the life of the nation. Unfortunately, he was assassinated
in 1582. To this day the memory of Nobunaga is execrated by the
Buddhists. They have deified Kato Kiyomasa and Iy&eacute;yas[)u],
the persecutors of the Christians. To Nobunaga they give the title
of Bakadono, or Lord Fool.</p>
<p>In 1583, an embassy of four young noblemen was despatched by the
Christian daimi[=o]s of Kiushiu, the second largest island in the
empire, to the Pope to declare themselves spiritual&mdash;though as
some of their countrymen suspected, political&mdash;vassals of the
Holy See. It was in the three provinces of Bungo, Omura and Arima,
that Christianity was most firmly rooted. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>{332}</span> After an
absence of eight years, in 1590, the envoys from the oriental to
the occidental ends of the earth, returned to Nagasaki, accompanied
by seventeen more Jesuit fathers&mdash;an important addition to the
many Portuguese "religious" of that order already in Japan.</p>
<p>Yet, although there was to be still much missionary activity,
though printing presses had been brought from Europe for the proper
diffusion of Christian literature in the Romanized
colloquial,<a id="footnotetag11-8" name=
"footnotetag11-8"></a><a href="#footnote11-8"><sup>8</sup></a>
though there were yet to be built more church edifices and
monasteries, and Christian schools to be established, a sad change
was nigh. Much seed which was yet to grow in secret had been
planted,&mdash;like the exotic flowers which even yet blossom and
shed their perfume in certain districts of Japan, and which the
traveller from Christendom instantly recognizes, though the
Portuguese Christian church or monastery centuries ago disappeared
in fire, or fell to the earth and disappeared. Though there were to
be yet wonderful flashes of Christian success, and the missionaries
were to travel over Japan even up to the end of the main island and
accompany the Japanese army to Korea; yet it may be said that with
the death of Nobunaga at the hands of the traitor Ak&eacute;chi, we
see the high-water mark of the flood-tide of Japanese Christianity.
"Ak&eacute;chi reigned three days," but after him were to arise a
ruler and central government jealous and hostile. After this flood
was to come slowly but surely the ebb-tide, until it should leave,
outwardly at least, all things as before.</p>
<p>The Jesuit fathers, with instant sensitiveness, felt the loss of
their champion and protector, Nobunaga. The rebel and assassin,
Ak&eacute;chi, ambitious to imitate and excel his master, promised
the Christians to do <span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id=
"page333"></a>{333}</span> more for them even than Nobunaga had
done, provided they would induce the daimi[=o] Takayama to join
forces with his. It is the record of their own friendly historian,
and not of an enemy, that they, led by the Jesuit father Organtin,
attempted this persuasion. To the honor of the Christian Japanese
Takayama, he refused.<a id="footnotetag11-9" name=
"footnotetag11-9"></a><a href="#footnote11-9"><sup>9</sup></a> On
the contrary, he marched his little army of a thousand men to
Ki[=o]to, and, though opposed to a force of eight thousand, held
the capital city until Hid&eacute;yoshi, the loyal general of the
Mikado, reached the court city and dispersed the assassin's band.
Hid&eacute;yoshi soon made himself familiar with the whole story,
and his keen eye took in the situation.</p>
<p>This "man on horseback," master of the situation and moulder of
the destinies of Japan, Hid&eacute;yoshi (1536-1598), was afterward
known as the Taik[=o], or Retired Regent. The rarity of the title
makes it applicable in common speech to this one person. Greater
than his dead master, Nobunaga, and ingenious in the arts of war
and peace, Hid&eacute;yoshi compelled the warring daimi[=o]s, even
the proud lord of Satsuma,<a id="footnotetag11-10" name=
"footnotetag11-10"></a><a href="#footnote11-10"><sup>10</sup></a>
to yield to his power, until the civil minister of the emperor,
reverently bowing, could say: "All under Heaven, Peace." Now, Japan
had once more a central government, intensely jealous and despotic,
and with it the new religion must sooner or later reckon. Religion
apart from politics was unknown in the Land of the Gods.</p>
<p>Yet, in order to employ the vast bodies of armed men hitherto
accustomed to the trade of war, and withal jealous of China and
hostile to Korea, Hid&eacute;yoshi planned the invasion of the
little peninsular kingdom by these veterans whose swords were
restless in their scabbards. After months of preparation, he
despatched <span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id=
"page334"></a>{334}</span> an army in two great divisions, one
under the Christian general Konishi, and one under the Buddhist
general Kato. After a brilliant campaign of eighteen days, the
rivals, taking different routes, met in the Korean capital. In the
masterly campaign which followed, the Japanese armies penetrated
almost to the extreme northern boundary of the kingdom. Then China
came to the rescue and the Japanese were driven southward.</p>
<p>During the six or seven years of war, while the invaders crossed
swords with the natives and their Chinese allies, and devastated
Korea to an extent from which she has never recovered, there were
Jesuit missionaries attending the Japanese armies. It is not
possible or even probable, however, that any seeds of Christianity
were at this time left in the peninsula. Korean Christianity sprang
up nearly two centuries later, wind-wafted from China.<a id=
"footnotetag11-11" name="footnotetag11-11"></a><a href=
"#footnote11-11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>During the war there was always more or less of jealousy, mostly
military and personal, between Konishi and Kato, which however was
aggravated by the priests on either side. Kato, being then and
afterward a fierce champion of the Buddhists, glorified in his
orthodoxy, which was that of the Nichiren sect. He went into battle
with a banneret full of texts, stuck in his back and flying behind
him. His example was copied by hundreds of his officers and
soldiers. On their flags and guidons was inscribed the famous
apostrophe of the Nichiren sect, so often heard in their services
and revivals to-day (Namu miy[=o] ho ren g&eacute; ki[=o]), and
borrowed from the Saddharma Pundarika: "Glory be to the
salvation-bringing Lotus of the True Law."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id=
"page335"></a>{335}</span>
<h3>The Hostility of Hid&eacute;yoshi.</h3>
<p>Konishi, on the other hand, was less numerously and perhaps less
influentially backed by, and made the champion of, the European
brethren; and as all the negotiations between the invaders and the
allied Koreans and Chinese had to be conducted in the Chinese
script, the alien fathers were, as secretaries and interpreters,
less useful than the native Japanese bonzes.</p>
<p>Yet this jealousy and hostility in the camps of the invaders
proved to be only correlative to the state of things in Japan. Even
supposing the statistics in round numbers, reported at that time,
to be exaggerated, and that there were not as many as the alleged
two hundred thousand Christians, yet there were, besides scores of
thousands of confessing believers among the common people,
daimi[=o]s, military leaders, court officers and many persons of
culture and influence. Nevertheless, the predominating influence at
the Ki[=o]to court was that of Buddhism; and as the cult that winks
at polygamy was less opposed to Hid&eacute;yoshi's sensualism and
amazing vanity, the illustrious upstart was easily made hostile to
the alien faith. According to the accounts of the Jesuits, he took
umbrage because a Portuguese captain would not please him by
risking his ship in coming out of deep water and nearer land, and
because there were Christian maidens of Arima who scorned to yield
to his degrading proposals. Some time after these episodes, an
edict appeared, commanding every Jesuit to quit the country within
twenty days. There were at this time sixty-five foreign
missionaries in the country.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id=
"page336"></a>{336}</span>
<p>Then began a series of persecutions, which, however, were
carried on spasmodically and locally, but not universally or with
system. Bitter in some places, they were neutralized or the law
became a dead letter, in other parts of the realm. It is estimated
that ten thousand new converts were made in the single year, 1589,
that is, the second year after the issue of the edict, and again in
the next year, 1590. It might even be reasonable to suppose that,
had the work been conducted wisely and without the too open
defiance of the letter of the law, the awful sequel which history
knows, might not have been.</p>
<p>Let us remember that the Duke of Alva, the tool of Philip II.,
failing to crush the Dutch Republic had conquered Portugal for his
master. The two kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula were now united
under one crown. Spain longed for trade with Japan, and while her
merchants hoped to displace their Portuguese rivals, the Spanish
Franciscans not scrupling to wear a political cloak and thus
override the Pope's bull of world-partition, determined to get a
foothold alongside of the Jesuits. So, in 1593 a Spanish envoy of
the governor of the Philippine Islands came to Ki[=o]to, bringing
four Spanish Franciscan priests, who were allowed to build houses
in Ki[=o]to, but only on the express understanding that this was
because of their coming as envoys of a friendly power, and with the
explicitly specified condition that they were not to preach, either
publicly or privately. Almost immediately violating their pledge
and the hospitality granted them, these Spaniards, wearing the
vestments of their order, openly preached in the streets. Besides
exciting discord among the Christian congregations <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>{337}</span> founded
by the Jesuits, they were violent in their language.</p>
<p>Hid&eacute;yoshi, to gratify his own mood and test his power as
the actual ruler for a shadowy emperor, seized nine preachers while
they were building churches at Ki[=o]to and Osaka. They were led to
the execution-ground in exactly the same fashion as felons, and
executed by crucifixion, at Nagasaki, February 5, 1597. Three
Portuguese Jesuits, six Spanish Franciscans and seventeen native
Christians were stretched on bamboo crosses, and their bodies from
thigh to shoulder were transfixed with spears. They met their doom
uncomplainingly.</p>
<p>In the eye of the Japanese law, these men were put to death, not
as Christians, but as law-breakers and as dangerous political
conspirators. The suspicions of Hid&eacute;yoshi were further
confirmed by a Spanish sea-captain, who showed him a map of the
world on which were marked the vast dominions of the King of Spain;
the Spaniard informing the Japanese, in answer to his shrewd
question, that these great conquests had been made by the king's
soldiers following up the priests, the work being finished by the
native and foreign allies.</p>
<h3>The Political Character of Roman Christianity.</h3>
<p>The Roman Catholic "Histoire del' &Eacute;glise
Chr&eacute;tienne" shows the political character of the missionary
movement in Japan, a character almost inextricably associated with
the papal and other political Christianity of the times, when State
and Church were united in all the countries of Europe, both
Catholic and Protestant. Even republican Holland, leader of
toleration and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id=
"page338"></a>{338}</span> forerunner of the modern Christian
spirit, permitted, indeed, the Roman Catholics to worship in
private houses or in sacred edifices not outwardly resembling
churches, but prohibited all public processions and ceremonies,
because religion and politics at that time were as Siamese twins.
Only the Anabaptists held the primitive Christian and the American
doctrine of the separation of politics from ecclesiasticism. Except
in the country ruled by William the Silent, all magistrates meddled
with men's consciences.<a id="footnotetag11-12" name=
"footnotetag11-12"></a><a href=
"#footnote11-12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1597, Hid&eacute;yoshi died, and the missionaries took heart
again. The Christian soldiers returning by thousands from Korea,
declared themselves in favor of Hid&eacute;yori, son of the dead
Taik[=o]. Encouraged by those in power, and by the rising star
Iy&eacute;yas[)u] (1542-1616), the fathers renewed their work and
the number of converts increased.</p>
<p>Though peace reigned, the political situation was one of the
greatest uncertainty, and with two hundred thousand soldiers
gathered around Ki[=o]to, under scores of ambitious leaders, it was
hard to keep the sword in the sheath. Soon the line of cleavage
found Iy&eacute;yas[)u] and his northern captains on one side, and
most of the Christian leaders and southern daimi[=o]s on the other.
In October, 1600, with seventy-five thousand men, the future
unifier of Japan stood on the ever-memorable field of
S&eacute;kigahara. The opposing army, led largely by Christian
commanders, left their fortress to meet the one whom they
considered a usurper, in the open field. In the battle which
ensued, probably the most decisive ever fought on the soil of
Japan, ten thousand men lost their lives. The leading Christian
generals, beaten, but refusing out of principle because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id=
"page339"></a>{339}</span> they were Christians, to take their own
lives by <i>hara-kiri</i>, knelt willingly at the common blood-pit
and had their heads stricken off by the executioner.</p>
<p>Then began a new era in the history of the empire, and then were
laid by Iy&eacute;yas[)u] the foundation-lines upon which the Japan
best known to Europe has existed for nearly three centuries. The
creation of a central executive government strong enough to rule
the whole empire, and hold down even the southern and southwestern
daimi[=o]s, made it still worse for the converts of the European
teachers, because in the Land of the Gods government is ever
intensely pagan.</p>
<p>In adjusting the feudal relations of his vassals in Kiushiu,
Iy&eacute;yas[)u] made great changes, and thus the political status
of the Christians was profoundly altered. The new daimi[=o]s,
carrying out the policy of their predecessors who had been taught
by the Jesuits, but reversing its direction, began to persecute
their Christian subjects, and to compel them to renounce their
faith. One of the leading opposers of the Christians and their most
cruel persecutor, was Kato, the zealous Nichirenite. Like Brandt,
the famous Iroquois Indian, who, in the Mohawk Valley is execrated
as a bloodthirsty brute, and on the Canadian side is honored with a
marble statue and considered not only as the translator of the
prayer-book but also as a saint; even also as Claverhouse, who, in
Scotland is looked upon as a murderous demon, but in England as a
conscientious and loyal patriot; so Kato, the <i>vir ter
execrandus</i> of the Jesuits, is worshipped in his shrine at the
Nichiren temple at Ik&eacute;gami, near T[=o]ki[=o],<a id=
"footnotetag11-13" name="footnotetag11-13"></a><a href=
"#footnote11-13"><sup>13</sup></a> and is praised by native
historians as learned, brave and true.</p>
<p>The Christians of Kiushiu, in a few cases, actually <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>{340}</span> took up
arms against their new rulers and oppressors, though it was a new
thing under the Japanese sun for peasantry to oppose not only civil
servants of the law, but veterans in armor. Iy&eacute;yas[)u], now
having time to give his attention wholly to matters of government
and to examine the new forces that had entered Japanese life,
followed Hid&eacute;yoshi in the suspicion that, under the cover of
the western religion, there lurked political designs. He thought he
saw confirmation of his theories, because the foreigners still
secretly or openly paid court to Hid&eacute;yori, and at the same
time freely disbursed gifts and gold as well as comfort to the
persecuted. Resolving to crush the spirit of independence in the
converts and to intimidate the foreign emissaries,
Iy&eacute;yas[)u] with steel and blood put down every outbreak, and
at last, in 1606, issued his edict<a id="footnotetag11-14" name=
"footnotetag11-14"></a><a href="#footnote11-14"><sup>14</sup></a>
prohibiting Christianity.</p>
<h3>The Quarrels of the Christians.</h3>
<p>About the same time, Protestant influences began to work against
the papal emissaries. The new forces from the triumphant Dutch
republic, which having successfully defied Spain for a whole
generation had reached Japan even before the Great Truce, were
opposed to the Spaniards and to the influence of both Jesuits and
Franciscans. Hollanders at Lisbon, obtaining from the Spanish
archives charts and geographical information, had boldly sailed out
into the Eastern seas, and carried the orange white and blue flag
to the ends of the earth, even to Nippon. Between Prince Maurice,
son of William the Silent, and the envoys of Iy&eacute;yas[)u],
there was made a league of commerce as well as of peace and
friendship. Will Adams,<a id="footnotetag11-15" name=
"footnotetag11-15"></a><a href="#footnote11-15"><sup>15</sup></a>
the English <span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id=
"page341"></a>{341}</span> pilot of the Dutch ships, by his
information given to Iy&eacute;yas[)u], also helped much to destroy
the Jesuits influence and to hurt their cause, while both the Dutch
and English were ever busy in disseminating both correct
information and polemic exaggeration, forging letters and
delivering up to death by fire the <i>padres</i> when captured at
sea.</p>
<p>In general, however, it may be said that while Christian
converts and the priests were roughly handled in the South, yet
there was considerable missionary activity and success in the
North. Converts were made and Christian congregations were gathered
in regions remote from Ki[=o]to and Yedo, which latter place, like
St. Petersburg in the West, was being made into a large city. Even
outlying islands, such as Sado, had their churches and
congregations.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Christian Policy of the Tokugawas.</h3>
<p>The quarrels between the Franciscans and Jesuits,<a id=
"footnotetag11-16" name="footnotetag11-16"></a><a href=
"#footnote11-16"><sup>16</sup></a> however, were probably more
harmful to Christianity than were the whispers of the Protestant
Englishmen or Hollanders. In 1610, the wrath of the government was
especially aroused against the <i>bateren</i>, as the people called
the <i>padres</i>, by their open and persistent violation of
Japanese law. In 1611, from Sado, to which island thousands of
Christian exiles had been sent to work the mines, Iy&eacute;yas[)u]
believed he had obtained documentary proof in the Japanese
language, of what he had long suspected&mdash;the existence of a
plot on the part of the native converts and the foreign emissaries
to reduce Japan to the position of a subject state.<a id=

"#footnote11-18"><sup>18</sup></a> in which the foreign priests
were branded as triple enemies&mdash;of the country, of the Kami,
and of the Buddhas. This proclamation wound up with the charge that
the Christian band had come to Japan to change the government of
the country, and to usurp possession of it. Whether or not he
really had sufficient written proof of conspiracy against the
nation's sovereignty, it is certain that in this state paper,
Iy&eacute;yas[)u] shrewdly touched the springs of Japanese
patriotism. Not desiring, however, to shed blood or provoke war, he
tried transportation. Three hundred persons, namely, twenty-two
Franciscans, Dominicans and Augustines, one hundred and seventeen
foreign Jesuits, and nearly two hundred native priests and
catechists, were arrested, sent to Nagasaki, and thence shipped
like bundles of combustibles to Macao.</p>
<p>Yet, as many of the foreign and native Christian teachers hid
themselves in the country and as others who had been banished
returned secretly and continued the work of propaganda, the crisis
had not yet come. Some of the Jesuit priests, even, were still
hoping that Hid&eacute;yori would mount to power; but in 1615,
Iy&eacute;yas[)u], finding a pretext for war,<a id=
"footnotetag11-19" name="footnotetag11-19"></a><a href=
"#footnote11-19"><sup>19</sup></a> called out a powerful army and
laid siege to the great castle of Osaka, the most imposing fortress
in the country. In the brief war which ensued, it is said by the
Jesuit fathers, that one hundred thousand men perished. On June 9,
1615, the castle was captured and the citadel burned. After
thousands of Hid&eacute;yori's followers had committed
<i>hara-kiri</i>, and his own body had been <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>{343}</span> burned
into ashes, the Christian cause was irretrievably ruined.</p>
<p>Hid&eacute;tada, the successor of Iy&eacute;yas[)u] in Yedo, who
ruled from 1605 to 1622, seeing that his father's peaceful methods
had failed in extirpating the alien politico-religious doctrine,
now pronounced sentence of death on every foreigner, priest, or
catechist found in the country. The story of the persecutions and
horrible sufferings that ensued is told in the voluminous
literature which may be gathered from every country in
Europe;<a id="footnotetag11-20" name=
"footnotetag11-20"></a><a href="#footnote11-20"><sup>20</sup></a>
though from the Japanese side "The Catholic martyrology of Japan is
still an untouched field for a [native] historian."<a id=
"footnotetag11-21" name="footnotetag11-21"></a><a href=
"#footnote11-21"><sup>21</sup></a> All the church edifices which
the last storm had left standing were demolished, and temples and
pagodas were erected upon their ruins. In 1617, foreign commerce
was restricted to Hirado and Nagasaki. In 1621, Japanese were
forbidden ever to leave the country. In 1624, all ships having a
capacity of over twenty-five hundred bushels were burned, and no
craft, except those of the size of ordinary junks, were allowed to
be built.</p>
<h3>The Books of the Inferno Opened.</h3>
<p>For years, at intervals and in places, the books of the Inferno
were opened, and the tortures devised by the native pagans and
Buddhists equalled in their horror those which Dante imagines,
until finally, in 1636, even Japanese human nature, accustomed for
ages to subordination and submission, could stand it no longer.
Then a man named Nirado Shiro raised the banner of the Virgin and
called on all Christians and others to follow him. Probably as many
as thirty <span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id=
"page344"></a>{344}</span> thousand men, women and children, but
without a single foreigner, lay or clerical, among them, gathered
from parts of Kiushiu. After burning Shint[=o] and Buddhist
temples, they fortified an old abandoned castle at Shimabara,
resolving to die rather than submit. Against an army of veterans,
led by skilled commanders, the fortress held out during four
months. At last, after a bloody assault, it was taken, and men,
women and children were slaughtered.<a id="footnotetag11-22" name=
"footnotetag11-22"></a><a href="#footnote11-22"><sup>22</sup></a>
Thousands suffered death at the point of the spear and sword; many
were thrown into the sea; and others were cast into boiling hot
springs, emblems of the eight Buddhist Hells.</p>
<p>All efforts were now put forth to uproot not only Christianity
but also everything of foreign planting. The Portuguese were
banished and the death penalty declared against all who should
return, The ai no ko, or half-breed children, were collected and
shipped by hundreds to Macao. All persons adopting or harboring
Eurasians were to be banished, and their relatives punished. The
Christian cause now became like the doomed city of Babylon or like
the site of Nineveh, which, buried in the sand and covered with the
desolation and silence of centuries, became lost to the memory of
the world, so that even the very record of scripture was the jest
of the infidel, until the spade of Layard brought them again to
resurrection. So, Japanese Christianity, having vanished in blood,
was supposed to have no existence, thus furnishing Mr. Lecky with
arguments to prove the extirpative power of persecution.<a id=
"footnotetag11-23" name="footnotetag11-23"></a><a href=
"#footnote11-23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Yet in 1859, on the opening of the country by treaty, the Roman
Catholic fathers at Nagasaki found to their <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>{345}</span> surprise
that they were re-opening the old mines, and that their work was in
historic continuity with that of their predecessors. The blood of
the martyrs had been the seed of the church. Amid much ignorance
and darkness, there were thousands of people who, through the
Virgin, worshipped God; who talked of Jesus, and of the Holy
Spirit; and who refused to worship at the pagan shrines<a id=
"footnotetag11-24" name="footnotetag11-24"></a><a href=
"#footnote11-24"><sup>24</sup></a>.</p>
<h3>Summary of Roman Christianity in Japan.</h3>
<p>Let us now strive impartially to appraise the Christianity of
this era, and inquire what it found, what it attempted to do, what
it did not strive to attain, what was the character of its
propagators, what was the mark it made upon the country and upon
the mind of the people, and whether it left any permanent
influence.</p>
<p>The gospel net which had gathered all sorts of fish in Europe
brought a varied quality of spoil to Japan. Among the Portuguese
missionaries, beginning with Xavier, there are many noble and
beautiful characters, who exemplified in their motives, acts, lives
and sufferings some of the noblest traits of both natural and
redeemed humanity. In their praise, both the pagan and the
Christian, as well as critics biased by their prepossessions in
favor either of the Reformed or the Roman phase of the faith, can
unite.</p>
<p>The character of the native converts is, in many instances, to
be commended, and shows the direct truth of Christianity in fields
of life and endeavor, in ethics and in conceptions, far superior to
those which the Japanese religious systems have produced. In the
teaching <span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id=
"page346"></a>{346}</span> that there should be but one standard of
morality for man and woman, and that the male as well as the female
should be pure; in the condemnation of polygamy and licentiousness;
in the branding of suicide as both wicked and cowardly; in the
condemnation of slavery; and in the training of men and women to
lofty ideals of character, the Christian teachers far excelled
their Buddhist or Confucian rivals.</p>
<p>The benefits which Japan received through the coming of the
Christian missionaries, as distinct and separate from those brought
by commerce and the merchants, are not to be ignored. While many
things of value and influence for material improvement, and many
beneficent details and elements of civilization were undoubtedly
imported by traders, yet it was the priests and itinerant
missionaries who diffused the knowledge of the importance of these
things and taught their use throughout the country. Although in the
reaction of hatred and bitterness, and in the minute, universal and
long-continued suppression by the government, most of this
advantage was destroyed, yet some things remained to influence
thought and speech, and to leave a mark not only on the language,
but also on the procedure of daily life. One can trace notable
modifications of Japanese life from this period, lasting through
the centuries and even until the present time.</p>
<p>Christianity, in the sixteenth century, came to Japan only in
its papal or Roman Catholic form. While in it was infused much of
the power and spirit of Loyola and Xavier, yet the impartial critic
must confess that this form was military, oppressive and
political.<a id="footnotetag11-25" name=
"footnotetag11-25"></a><a href="#footnote11-25"><sup>25</sup></a>
Nevertheless, though it was impure and saturated with <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>{347}</span> the false
principles, the vices and the embodied superstitions of corrupt
southern Europe, yet, such as it was, Portuguese Christianity
confronted the worst condition of affairs, morally, intellectually
and materially, which Japan has known in historic times. Defective
as the critic must pronounce the system of religion imported from
Europe, it was immeasurably superior to anything that the Japanese
had hitherto known.</p>
<p>It must be said, also, that Portuguese Christianity in Japan
tried to do something more than the mere obtaining of adherents or
the nominal conversion of the people.<a id="footnotetag11-26" name=
"footnotetag11-26"></a><a href="#footnote11-26"><sup>26</sup></a>
It attempted to purify and exalt their life, to make society
better, to improve the relations between rulers and ruled; but it
did not attempt to do what it ought to have done. It ignored great
duties and problems, while it imitated too fully, not only the
example of the kings of this world in Europe but also of the rulers
in Japan. In the presence of soldier-like Buddhist priests, who had
made war their calling, it would have been better if the Christian
missionaries had avoided their bad example, and followed only in
the footsteps of the Prince of Peace; but they did not. On the
contrary, they brought with them the spirit of the Inquisition then
in full blast in Spain and Portugal, and the machinery with which
they had been familiar for the reclamation of native and Dutch
"heretics." Xavier, while at Goa, had even invoked the secular arm
to set up the Inquisition in India, and doubtless he and his
followers would have put up this infernal enginery in Japan if they
could have done so. They had stamped and crushed out "heresy" in
their own country, by a system of hellish <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>{348}</span> tortures
which in its horrible details is almost indescribable. The rusty
relics now in the museums of Europe, but once used in church
discipline, can be fully appreciated only by a physician or an
anatomist. In Japan, with the spirit of Alva and Philip II., these
believers in the righteousness of the Inquisition attacked
violently the character of native bonzes, and incited their
converts to insult the gods, destroy the Buddhist images, and burn
or desecrate the old shrines. They persuaded the daimi[=o]s, when
these lords had become Christians, to compel their subjects to
embrace their religion on pain of exile or banishment. Whole
districts were ordered to become Christian. The bonzes were exiled
or killed, and fire and sword as well as preaching, were employed
as means of conversion. In ready imitation of the Buddhists,
fictitious miracles were frequently got up to utilize the credulity
of the superstitious in furthering the faith&mdash;all of which is
related not by hostile critics, but by admiring historians and by
sympathizing eye-witnesses.<a id="footnotetag11-27" name=
"footnotetag11-27"></a><a href=
"#footnote11-27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>The most prominent feature of the Roman Catholicism of Japan,
was its political animus and complexion. In writings of this era,
Japanese historians treat of the Christian missionary movement less
as something religious, and more as that which influenced
government and polities, rather than society on its moral side. So
also, the impartial historian must consider that, on the whole,
despite the individual instances of holy lives and unselfish
purposes, the work of the Portuguese and Spanish friars and
"fathers" was, in the main, an attempt to bring Japan more or less
directly within the power of the Pope or of those rulers called
Most Catholic Majesties, Christian Kings, etc., even as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id=

America, and large portions of India under the same control. The

<h2>CHAPTER XII - TWO CENTURIES OF SILENCE</h2>
<h3>The Japanese Shut In.</h3>
<p>Sincerely regretting that we cannot pass more favorable
judgments upon the Christianity of the seventeenth century in
Japan, let us look into the two centuries of silence, and see what
was the story between the paling of the Christian record in 1637,
and the glowing of the palimpsest in 1859, when the new era
begins.</p>
<p>The policy of the Japanese rulers, after the supposed utter
extirpation of Christianity, was the double one of exclusion and
inclusion. A deliberate attempt, long persisted in and for
centuries apparently successful, was made to insulate Japan from
the shock of change. The purpose was to draw a whole nation and
people away from the currents and movements of humanity, and to
stereotype national thought and custom. This was carried out in two
ways: first, by exclusion, and then by inclusion. All foreign
influences were shut off, or reduced to a minimum. The whole
western world, especially Christendom, was put under ban.</p>
<p>Even the apparent exception made in favor of the Dutch was with
the motive of making isolation more complete, and of securing the
perfect safety which that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page354"
id="page354"></a>{354}</span> isolation was expected to bring. For,
having built, not indeed with brick and mortar, but by means of
edict and law, both open and secret, a great wall of exclusion more
powerful than that of China's, it was necessary that there should
be a port-hole, for both sally and exit, and a slit for vigilant
scrutiny of any attempt to force seclusion or violate the frontier.
Hence, the Hollanders were allowed to have a small place of
residence in front of a large city and at the head of a land-locked
harbor. There, the foreigners being isolated and under strict
guard, the government could have, as it were, a nerve which touched
the distant nations, and could also, as with a telescope, sweep the
horizon for signs of danger.</p>
<p>So, in 1640, the Hollanders were ordered to evacuate Hirado, and
occupy the little "outer island" called D&eacute;shima, in front of
the city of Nagasaki, and connected therewith by a bridge. Any
ships entering this hill-girdled harbor, it was believed, could be
easily managed by the military resources possessed by the
government. Vessels were allowed yearly to bring the news from
abroad and exchange the products of Japan for those of Europe. The
English, who had in 1617 opened a trade and conducted a factory for
some years,<a id="footnotetag12-1" name=
"footnotetag12-1"></a><a href="#footnote12-1"><sup>1</sup></a> were
unable to compete with the Dutch, and about 1624, after having lost
in the venture forty thousand pounds sterling, withdrew entirely
from the Japanese trade. The Dutch were thus left without a rival
from Christendom.</p>
<p>Japan ceased her former trade and communications with the
Philippine Islands, Annam, Siam, the Spice Islands and India,<a id=
"footnotetag12-2" name="footnotetag12-2"></a><a href=
"#footnote12-2"><sup>2</sup></a> and begun to restrict trade and
communication with Korea and China. The Koreans, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>{355}</span> who were
considered as vassals, or semi-vassals, came to Japan to present
their congratulations on the accession of each new Sh[=o]gun; and
some small trade was done at Fusan under the superintendence of the
daimi[=o] of Tsushima. Even this relation with Korea was rather one
of watchfulness. It sprang from the pride of a victor rather than
from any desire to maintain relations with the rest of the world.
As for China, the communication with her was astonishingly little,
only a few junks crossing yearly between Nankin and Nagasaki; so
that, with the exception of one slit in their tower of observation,
the Japanese became well isolated from the human family.</p>
<p>This system of exclusion was accompanied by an equally vigorous
policy of inclusiveness. It was deliberately determined to keep the
people from going abroad, either in their bodies or minds. All
seaworthy ships were destroyed. Under pain of imprisonment and
death, all natives were forbidden to go to a foreign country,
except in the rare cases of urgent government service. By settled
precedents it was soon made to be understood that those who were
blown out to sea or carried away in stress of weather, need not
come back; if they did, they must return only on Chinese and Korean
vessels, and even then would be grudgingly allowed to land. It was
given out, both at home and to the world, that no shipwrecked
sailors or waifs would be welcomed when brought on foreign
vessels.</p>
<p>This inclusive policy directed against physical exportation, was
still more stringently carried out when applied to imports
affecting the minds of the Japanese. The "government deliberately
attempted to establish a society impervious to foreign ideas from
without, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id=
"page356"></a>{356}</span> and fostered within by all sorts of
artificial legislation. This isolation affected every department of
private and public life. Methods of education were cast in a
definite mould; even matters of dress and household architecture
were strictly regulated by the State, and industries were
restricted or forced into specified channels, thus retarding
economic developments."<a id="footnotetag12-3" name=
"footnotetag12-3"></a><a href="#footnote12-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h3>Starving of the Mind.</h3>
<p>In the science of keeping life within stunted limits and
artificial boundaries, the Japanese genius excels. It has been well
said that "the Japanese mind is great in little things and little
in great things." To cut the tap-root of a pine-shoot, and, by
regulating the allowance of earth and water, to raise a pine-tree
which when fifty years old shall be no higher than a silver dollar,
has been the proud ambition of many an artist in botany. In like
manner, the Tokugawa Sh[=o]guns (1604-1868) determined to so limit
the supply of mental food, that the mind of Japan should be of
those correctly dwarfed proportions of puniness, so admired by
lovers of artificiality and unconscious caricature. Philosophy was
selected as a chief tool among the engines of oppression, and as
the main influence in stunting the intellect. All thought must be
orthodox according to the standards of Confucianism, as expounded
by Chu Hi. Anything like originality in poetry, learning or
philosophy must be hooted down. Art must follow Chinese, Buddhist
and Japanese traditions. Any violation of this order would mean
ostracism. All learning must be in the Chinese and Japanese
languages&mdash;the former mis-pronounced and in <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>{357}</span> sound
bearing as much resemblance to Pekingise speech as "Pennsylvania
Dutch" does to the language of Berlin. Everything like thinking and
study must be with a view of sustaining and maintaining the
established order of things. The tree of education, instead of
being a lofty or wide-spreading cryptomeria, must be the measured
nursling of the teacup. If that trio of emblems, so admired by the
natives, the bamboo, pine and plum, could produce glossy leaves,
ever-green needles and fragrant blooms within a space of four cubic
inches, so the law, the literature and the art of Japan must
display their normal limit of fresh fragrance, of youthful vigor
and of venerable age, enduring for aye, within the vessel of
Japanese inclusion so carefully limited by the Yedo
authorities.</p>
<p>Such a policy, reminds one of the Amherst agricultural
experiment in which bands of iron were strapped around a
much-afflicted squash, in order to test vital potency. It recalls
the pretty little story of Picciola, in which a tender plant must
grow between the interstices of the bricks in a prison yard.
Besides the potent bonds of the only orthodox Confucian philosophy
which was allowed and the legally recognized religions, there was
gradually formed a marvellous system of legislation, that turned
the whole nation into a secret society in which spies and
hypocrites flourished like fungus on a dead log. Besides the
unwritten code of private law,<a id="footnotetag12-4" name=
"footnotetag12-4"></a><a href="#footnote12-4"><sup>4</sup></a> that
is, the local and general customs founded on immemorial usage,
there was that peculiar legal system framed by Iy&eacute;yas[)u],
bequeathed as a legacy and for over two hundred years practically
the supreme law of the land.</p>
<p>What this law was, it was exceedingly difficult, if not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id=
"page358"></a>{358}</span> utterly impossible, for the aliens
dwelling in the country at Nagasaki ever to find out. Keenly
intellectual, as many of the physicians, superintendents and elect
members of the Dutch trading company were, they seem never to have
been able to get hold of what has been called "The Testament of
Iy&eacute;yas[)u]."<a id="footnotetag12-5" name=
"footnotetag12-5"></a><a href="#footnote12-5"><sup>5</sup></a> This
consisted of one hundred laws or regulations, based on a home-spun
sort of Confucianism, intended to be orthodoxy "unbroken for ages
eternal."</p>
<p>To a man of western mode of thinking, the most astonishing thing
is that this law was esoteric.<a id="footnotetag12-6" name=
"footnotetag12-6"></a><a href="#footnote12-6"><sup>6</sup></a> The
people knew of it only by its irresistible force, and by the
constant pressure or the rare easing of its iron hand. Those who
executed the law were drilled in its routine from childhood, and
this routine became second nature. Only a few copies of the
original instrument were known, and these were kept with a secrecy
which to the people became a sacred mystery guarded by a long
avenue of awe.</p>
<h3>The Dutchmen at D&eacute;shima.</h3>
<p>The Dutchmen who lived at D&eacute;shima for two centuries and a
half, and the foreigners who first landed at the treaty ports in
1859, on inquiring about the methods of the Japanese Government,
the laws and their administration, found that everything was veiled
behind a vague embodiment of something which was called "the Law."
What that law was, by whom enacted, and under what sanctions
enforced, no one could tell; though all seemed to stand in awe of
it as something of superhuman efficiency. Its mysteriousness was
only equalled by the abject submission which it received.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id=
"page359"></a>{359}</span>
<p>Foreign diplomatists, on trying to deal with the seat and source
of authority, instead of seeing the real head of power, played, as
it were, a game of chess against a mysterious hand stretched out
from behind a curtain. Morally, the whole tendency of such a dual
system of exclusion and of inclusion was to make a nation of liars,
foster confirmed habits of deceit, and create a code of politeness
vitiated by insincerity.</p>
<p>With such repression of the natural powers of humanity, it was
but in accordance with the nature of things that licentiousness
should run riot, that on the fringes of society there should be the
outcast and the pariah, and that the social waste of humanity by
prostitution, by murder, by criminal execution under a code that
prescribed the death penalty for hundreds of offences, should be
enormous. It is natural also that in such a state of society
population<a id="footnotetag12-7" name=
"footnotetag12-7"></a><a href="#footnote12-7"><sup>7</sup></a>
should be kept down within necessary limits, not only by famine, by
the restraints of feudalism, by legalized murder in the form of
vendetta, by a system of prostitution that made and still makes
Japan infamous, by child murder, by lack of encouragement given to
feeble or malformed children to live, and by various devices known
to those who were ingenious in keeping up so artificial a state of
society.</p>
<p>That there were many who tried to break through this wall, from
both the inside and the outside, and to force the frontiers of
exclusion and inclusion, is not to be wondered at. Externally,
there were bold spirits from Christendom who burned to know the
secrets of the mysterious land. Some even yearned to wear the ruby
crown. The wonderful story of past Christian triumphs deeply
stirred the heart of more than one <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page360" id="page360"></a>{360}</span> fiery spirit, and so we
find various attempts made by the clerical brethren of southern
Europe to enter the country. Bound by their promises, the Dutch
captains could not introduce these emissaries of a banned religion
within the borders; yet there are several notable instances of
Roman Catholic "religious"<a id="footnotetag12-8" name=
"footnotetag12-8"></a><a href="#footnote12-8"><sup>8</sup></a>
getting themselves left by shipmasters on the shores of Japan. The
lion's den of reality was Yedo. Like the lion's den of fable, the
footprints all led one way, and where these led the bones of the
victims soon lay.</p>
<p>Besides these men with religious motives, the ships of the West
came with offers of trade and threats of invasion. These were
English, French, Russian and American, and the story of the
frequent episodes has been told by Hildreth, Aston,<a id=
"footnotetag12-9" name="footnotetag12-9"></a><a href=
"#footnote12-9"><sup>9</sup></a> Nitob&eacute;, and others. There
is also a considerable body of native literature which gives the
inside view of these efforts to force the seclusion of the hermit
nation, and coax or compel the Japanese to be more sociable and
more human. All were in vain until the peaceful armada, under the
flag of thirty-one stars, led by Matthew Calbraith Perry,<a id=
"footnotetag12-10" name="footnotetag12-10"></a><a href=
"#footnote12-10"><sup>10</sup></a> broke the long seclusion of this
Thorn-rose of the Pacific, and the unarmed diplomacy of Townsend
Harris,<a id="footnotetag12-11" name=
"footnotetag12-11"></a><a href="#footnote12-11"><sup>11</sup></a>
brought Japan into the brotherhood of commercial and Christian
nations.</p>
<p>Within the isolating walls and the barred gates the story of the
seekers after God is a thrilling one. The intellect of choice
spirits, beating like caged eagles the bars of their prisons,
yearned for more light and life. "Though an eagle be starving,"
says the Japanese proverb, "it will not eat grain;" and so, while
the mass of the people and even the erudite, were content with
ground food&mdash;even the chopped straw and husks of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>{361}</span>
materialistic Confucianism and decayed Buddhism&mdash;there were
noble souls who soared upward to exercise their God-given powers,
and to seek nourishment fitted for that human spirit which goeth
upward and not downward, and which, ever in restless discontent,
seeks the Infinite.</p>
<h3>Protests of Inquiring Spirits.</h3>
<p>There is no stronger proof of the true humanity and the innate
god-likeness of the Japanese, of their worthiness to hold and their
inherent power to win a high place among the nations of the earth,
than this longing of a few elect ones for the best that earth could
give and Heaven bestow. We find men in travail of spirit, groping
after God if haply they might find Him, following the ways of the
Spirit along lines different, and in pathways remote, from those
laid down by Confucius and his materialistic commentators, or by
Buddha and his parodists or caricaturists. The story of the
philosophers, who mutinied against the iron clamps and
governmentally nourished system of the S&eacute;ido College
expounders, is yet to be fully told.<a id="footnotetag12-12" name=
"footnotetag12-12"></a><a href="#footnote12-12"><sup>12</sup></a>
It behooves some Japanese scholar to tell it.</p>
<p>How earnest truth-seeking Japanese protested and rebelled
against the economic fallacies, against the political despotism,
against the abominable usurpations, against the false strategies
and against the inherent immoralities of the Tokugawa system, has
of late years been set forth with tantalizing suggestiveness, but
only in fragments, by the native historians. Heartrending is the
narrative of these men who studied, who taught, who examined, who
sifted the mountains of chaff in the native literature and
writings, who made <span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id=
"page362"></a>{362}</span> long journeys on foot all over the
country, who furtively travelled in Korea and China, who boarded
Dutch and Russian vessels, who secretly read forbidden books, who
tried to improve their country and their people. These men saw that
their country was falling behind not only the nations of the West,
but, as it seemed to them, even the nations of the East. They felt
that radical changes were necessary in order to reform the awful
poverty, disease, licentiousness, national weakness, decay of
bodily powers, and the creeping paralysis of the Samurai intellect
and spirit. How they were ostracized, persecuted, put under ban,
hounded by the spies, thrown into prison; how they died of
starvation or of disease; how they were beheaded, crucified, or
compelled to commit <i>hara-kiri</i>; how their books were purged
by the censors, or put under ban or destroyed,<a id=
"footnotetag12-13" name="footnotetag12-13"></a><a href=
"#footnote12-13"><sup>13</sup></a> and their maps, writings and
plates burned, has not yet been told. It is a story that, when
fully narrated, will make a volume of extraordinary interest. It is
a story which both Christian and human interests challenge some
native author to tell. During all this time, but especially during
the first half of the nineteenth century, there was one steady goal
to which the aspiring student ever kept his faith, and to which his
feet tended. There was one place of pilgrimage, toward which the
sons of the morning moved, and which, despite the spy and the
informer and the vigilance of governors, fed their spirits, and
whence they carried the sacred fire, or bore the seed whose harvest
we now see. That goal of the pilgrim band was Nagasaki, and the
place where the light burned and the sacred flames were kindled was
D&eacute;shima. The men who helped to make true patriots, daring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id=
"page363"></a>{363}</span> thinkers, inquirers after truth,
bringers in of a better time, yes, and even Christians and
preachers of the good news of God, were these Dutchmen of
D&eacute;shima.</p>
<h3>A Handful of Salt in a Stagnant Mass.</h3>
<p>The Nagasaki Hollanders were not immaculate saints, neither were
they sooty devils. They did not profess to be Christian
missionaries. On the other hand, they were men not devoid of
conscience nor of sympathy with aspiring and struggling men in a
hermit nation, eager for light and truth. The Dutchman during the
time of hermit Japan, as we see him in the literature of men who
were hostile in faith and covetous rivals in trade, is a repulsive
figure. He seems to be a brutal wretch, seeking only gain, and
willing to sell conscience, humanity and his religion, for pelf. In
reality, he was an ordinary European, probably no better, certainly
no worse, than his age or the average man of his country or of his
continent. Further, among this average dozen of exiles in the
interest of commerce, science or culture, there were frequently
honorable men far above the average European, and shining examples
of Christianity and humanity. Even in his submission to the laws of
the country, the Dutchman did no more, no less, but exactly as the
daimi[=o]s,<a id="footnotetag12-14" name=
"footnotetag12-14"></a><a href="#footnote12-14"><sup>14</sup></a>
who like himself were subject to the humiliations imposed by the
rulers in Yedo.</p>
<p>It was the Dutch, who, for two hundred years supplied the
culture of Europe to Japan, introduced Western science, furnished
almost the only intellectual stimulant, and were the sole teachers
of medicine and science.<a id="footnotetag12-15" name=
"footnotetag12-15"></a><a href="#footnote12-15"><sup>15</sup></a>
They trained up hundreds of Japanese <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page364" id="page364"></a>{364}</span> to be physicians who
practised rational medicine and surgery. They filled with needed
courage the hearts of men, who, secretly practising dissection of
the bodies of criminals, demonstrated the falsity of Chinese ideas
of anatomy. It was Dutch science which exploded and drove out of
Japan that Chinese system of medicine, by means of which so many
millions have, during the long ages, been slowly tortured to
death.</p>
<p>The D&eacute;shima Dutchman was a kindly adviser, helper, guide
and friend, the one means of communication with the world, a
handful of salt in the stagnant mass. Long before the United
States, or Commodore Perry, the Hollanders advised the Yodo
government in favor of international intercourse. The Dutch
language, nearest in structure and vocabulary to the English, even
richer in the descriptive energy of its terms, and saturated withal
with Christian truth, was studied by eager young men. These
speakers of an impersonal language which in psychological
development was scarcely above the grade of childhood, were
exercised in a tongue that stands second to none in Europe for
purity, vigor, personality and philosophical power. The Japanese
students of Dutch held a golden key which opened the treasures of
modern thought and of the world's literature. The minds of thinking
Japanese were thus made plastic for the reception of the ideas of
Christianity. Best of all, though forbidden by their contracts to
import Bibles into Japan, the Dutchmen, by means of works of
reference, pointed more than one inquiring spirit to the
information by which the historic Christ became known. The books
which they imported, the information which they gave, the stimulus
which they imparted, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id=
"page365"></a>{365}</span> were as seeds planted within
masonry-covered earth, that were to upheave and overthrow the
fabric of exclusion and inclusion reared by the Tokugawa
Sh[=o]guns.</p>
<p>Time and space fail us to tell how eager spirits not only groped
after God, but sought the living Christ&mdash;though often this
meant to them imprisonment, suicide enforced by the law, or
decapitation. Yet over all Japan, long before the broad pennant of
Perry was mirrored on the waters of Yedo Bay, there were here and
there masses of leavened opinion, spots of kindled light, and
fields upon which the tender green sprouts of new ideas could be
detected. To-day, as inquiry among the oldest of the Christian
leaders and scores of volumes of modern biography shows, the most
earnest and faithful among the preachers, teachers and soldiers in
the Christian army, were led into their new world of ideas through
Dutch culture. The fact is revealed in repeated instances, that,
through father, grandfather, uncle, or other relative&mdash;some
pilgrim to the Dutch at Nagasaki&mdash;came their first knowledge,
their initial promptings, the environment or atmosphere, which made
them all sensitive and ready to receive the Christian truth when it
came in its full form from the living missionary and the vital word
of God. Some one has well said that the languages of modern Europe
are nothing more than Christianity expressed with differing
pronunciation and vocabulary. To him who will receive it, the
mastery of any one of the languages of Christendom, is, in a large
sense, a revelation of God in Christ Jesus.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id=
"page366"></a>{366}</span>
<h3>Seekers after God.</h3>
<p>Pathetic, even to the compulsion of tears, is the story of these
seekers after God. We, who to-day are surrounded by every motive
and inducement to Christian living and by every means and appliance
for the practice of the Christian life, may well consider for a
moment the struggle of earnest souls to find out God. Think of this
one who finds a Latin Bible cast up on the shore from some broken
ship, and bearing it secretly in his bosom to the Hollander, gains
light as to the meaning of its message. Think of the nobleman,
Watanab&eacute; Oboru,<a id="footnotetag12-16" name=
"footnotetag12-16"></a><a href="#footnote12-16"><sup>16</sup></a>
who, by means of the Japanese interpreter of Dutch, Takano
Choy&eacute;i, is thrilled with the story of Jesus of Nazareth who
helped and healed and spake as no other man spake, teaching with an
authority above that of the masters Confucius or Buddha. Think of
the daimi[=o] of Mito,<a id="footnotetag12-17" name=
"footnotetag12-17"></a><a href="#footnote12-17"><sup>17</sup></a>
who, proud in lineage, learned and scholarly, and surrounded by a
host of educated men, is yet unsatisfied with what the wise of his
own country could give him, and gathers around him the relics
unearthed from the old persecutions. From a picture of the Virgin,
a fragment of a litany, or it may be a part of a breviary, he tries
to make out what Christianity is.</p>
<p>Think of Yokoi H&eacute;ishiro,<a id="footnotetag12-18" name=
"footnotetag12-18"></a><a href="#footnote12-18"><sup>18</sup></a>
learned in Confucius and his commentators, who seeks better light,
sends to China for a Chinese translation of the New Testament, and
in his lectures on the Confucian ethics, to the delight and yet to
the surprise of his hearers who hear grander truth than they are
able to find in text or commentary, really preaches Christ, and
prophesies that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id=
"page367"></a>{367}</span> the time will come when the walls of
isolation being levelled, the brightest intellects of Japan will
welcome this same Jesus and His doctrine. Think of him again, when
unable to purify the Augean stables of Yedo's moral corruption,
because the time was at hand for other cleansing agencies, he
retires to his home, content awhile with his books and flowers.
Again, see him summoned to the capital, to sit at
Ki[=o]to&mdash;like aged Franklin among the young statesmen of the
Constitution in Philadelphia&mdash;with the Mikado's youthful
advisers in the new government of 1868. Think of him pleading for
the elevation of the pariah Eta, accursed and outcast through
Buddhism, to humanity and citizenship. Then hear him urge
eloquently the right of personal belief, and argue for toleration
under the law, of opinions, which the Japanese then stigmatized as
"evil" and devilish, but which we, and many of them now, call sound
and Christian. Finally, behold him at night in the public streets,
assaulted by assassins, and given quick death by their bullet and
blades. See his gray head lying severed from his body and in its
own gore, the wretched murderers thinking they have stayed the
advancing tide of Christianity; but at home there dwells a little
son destined in God's providence to become an earnest Christian and
one of the brilliant leaders of the native Christianity of Japan in
our day.</p>
<h3>The Buddhist Inquisitors.</h3>
<p>During the nation's period of Thorn-rose-like seclusion, the
three religions recognized by the law were Buddhism, Shint[=o] and
Confucianism. Christianity <span class="pagenum"><a name="page368"
id="page368"></a>{368}</span> was the outlawed sect. All over the
country, on the high-roads, at the bridges, and in the villages,
towns and cities, the fundamental laws of the country were written
on wooden tablets called kosats[)u]. These, framed and roofed for
protection from the weather, but easily before the eyes of every
man, woman and child, and written in a style and language
understood of all, denounced the Christian religion as an accursed
"sect," and offered gold to the spy and informer;<a id=
"footnotetag12-19" name="footnotetag12-19"></a><a href=
"#footnote12-19"><sup>19</sup></a> while once a year every Samurai
was required to swear on the true faith of a gentleman that he had
nothing to do with Christianity. From the seventeenth century, the
country having been divided into parishes, the inquisition was
under the charge of the Buddhist priests who penetrated into the
house and family and guarded the graveyards, so that neither earth
nor fire should embrace the carcass of a Christian, nor his dust or
ashes defile the ancestral graveyards. Twice&mdash;in 1686 and in
1711&mdash;were the rewards increased and the Buddhist bloodhounds
of Japan's Inquisition set on fresh trails. On one occasion, at
Osaka, in 1839,<a id="footnotetag12-20" name=
"footnotetag12-20"></a><a href="#footnote12-20"><sup>20</sup></a> a
rebellion broke out which was believed, though without evidence, to
have been instigated in some way by men with Christian ideas, and
was certainly led by Oshio, the bitter opponent of Buddhism, of
Tokugawa, and of the prevalent Confucianism. Possibly, the uprising
was aided by refugees from Korea. Those implicated were, after
speedy trial, crucified or beheaded. In the southern part of the
country the ceremony of Ebumi or trampling on the cross,<a id=
"footnotetag12-21" name="footnotetag12-21"></a><a href=
"#footnote12-21"><sup>21</sup></a> was long performed. Thousands of
people were made to pass through a wicket, beneath which and on the
ground lay a copper plate engraved with the image of the Christ and
the cross. In this <span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id=
"page369"></a>{369}</span> way it was hoped to utterly eradicate
the very memory of Christianity, which, to the common people, had
become the synonym for sorcery.</p>
<p>But besides the seeking after God by earnest souls and the
protest of philosophers, there was, amid the prevailing immorality
and the agnosticism and scepticism bred by decayed Buddhism and the
materialistic philosophy based on Confucius, some earnest struggles
for the purification of morals and the spiritual improvement of the
people.</p>
<h3>The Shingaku Movement.</h3>
<p>One of the most remarkable of the movements to this end was that
of the Shingaku or New Learning. A class of practical moralists, to
offset the prevailing tendency of the age to much speculation and
because Buddhism did so little for the people, tried to make the
doctrines of Confucius a living force among the great mass of
people. This movement, though Confucian in its chief tone and
color, was eclectic and intended to combine all that was best in
the Chinese system with what could be utilized from Shint[=o] and
Buddhism. With the preaching was combined a good deal of active
benevolence. Especially in the time of famine, was care for
humanity shown. The effect upon the people was noticeable,
followers multiplied rapidly, and it is said that even the
government in many instances made them, the Shingaku preachers, the
distributors of rice and alms for the needy. Some of the preachers
became famous and counted among their followers many men of
influence. The literary side of the movement<a id=
"footnotetag12-22" name="footnotetag12-22"></a><a href=
"#footnote12-22"><sup>22</sup></a> has been brought to the
attention <span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id=
"page370"></a>{370}</span> of English readers through Mr. Mitford's
translation of three sermons from the volume entitled Shingaku
D[=o]wa. Other discourses have been from time to time rendered into
English, those by Shibata, entitled The Sermons of the Dove-like
Venerable Master, being especially famous.</p>
<p>This movement, interesting as it was, came to an end when the
country began to be convulsed by the approaching entrance of
foreigners, through the Perry treaty; but it serves to show, what
we believe to be the truth, that the moral rottenness as well as
the physical decay of the Japanese people reached their acme just
previous to the apparition of the American fleet in 1853.</p>
<p>The story of nineteenth century Reformed Christianity in Japan
does not begin with Perry, or with Harris, or with the arrival of
Christian missionaries in 1859; for it has a subterranean and
interior history, as we have hinted; while that of the Roman form
and order is a story of unbroken continuity, though the life of the
tunnel is now that of the sunny road. The parable of the leaven is
first illustrated and then that of the mustard-seed. Before
Christianity was phenomenal, it was potent. Let us now look from
the interior to the outside.</p>
<p>On Perry's flag-ship, the Mississippi, the Bible lay open, a
sermon was preached, and the hymn "Before Jehovah's Awful Throne"
was sung, waking the echoes of the Japan hills. The Christian day
of rest was honored on this American squadron. In the treaty signed
in 1854, though it was made, indeed, with use of the name of God
and terms of Christian chronology, there was nothing upon which to
base, either by right or privilege, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page371" id="page371"></a>{371}</span> the residence of
missionaries in the country. Townsend Harris, the American
Consul-General, who hoisted his flag and began his hermit life at
Shimoda, in September, 1855, had as his only companion a Dutch
secretary, Mr. Heusken, who was later, in Yedo, to be assassinated
by ronins.</p>
<p>Without ship or soldier, overcoming craft and guile, and winning
his way by simple honesty and perseverance, Mr. Harris obtained
audience<a id="footnotetag12-23" name=
"footnotetag12-23"></a><a href="#footnote12-23"><sup>23</sup></a>
of "the Tycoon" in Yedo, and later from the Sh[=o]gun's daring
minister Ii, the signature to a treaty which guaranteed to
Americans the rights of residence, trade and commerce. Thus
Americans were enabled to land as citizens, and pursue their
avocation as religious teachers. As the government of the United
States of America knows nothing of the religion of American
citizens abroad, it protects all missionaries who are law-abiding
citizens, without regard to creed.<a id="footnotetag12-24" name=
"footnotetag12-24"></a><a href=
"#footnote12-24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h3>Japan Once More Missionary Soil.</h3>
<p>The first missionaries were on the ground as soon as the ports
were open. Though surrounded by spies and always in danger of
assassination and incendiarism, they began their work of mastering
the language. To do this without trained teachers or apparatus of
dictionary and grammar, was then an appalling task. The medical
missionary began healing the swarms of human sufferers, syphilitic,
consumptive, and those scourged by small-pox, cholera and
hereditary and acute diseases of all sorts. The patience, kindness
and persistency of these Christian men literally turned the edge of
the sword, disarmed the assassin, made the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>{372}</span> spies'
occupation useless, shamed away the suspicious, and conquered the
nearly invincible prejudices of the government. Despite the awful
under-tow in the immorality of the sailor, the adventurer and the
gain-greedy foreigner, the tide of Christianity began steadily to
rise. Notwithstanding the outbursts of the flames of persecution,
the torture and imprisonment of Christian captives and exiles, and
the slow worrying to death of the missionary's native teachers,
inquirers came and converts were made. In 1868, after revolution
and restoration, the old order changed, and duarchy and feudalism
passed away. Quick to seize the opportunity, Dr. J.C. Hepburn,
healer of bodies and souls of men, presented a Bible to the
Emperor, and the gift was accepted.</p>
<p>No sooner had the new government been established in safety, and
the name of Yedo, the city of the Baydoor, been changed into that
of T[=o]ki[=o], the Eastern Capital, than an embassy<a id=
"footnotetag12-25" name="footnotetag12-25"></a><a href=
"#footnote12-25"><sup>25</sup></a> of seventy persons started on
its course round the world. At its head were three cabinet
ministers of the new government and the court noble, Iwakura, of
immemorial lineage, in whose veins ran the blood of the men called
gods. Across the Pacific to the United States they went, having
their initial audience of the President of the Republic that knows
no state church, and whose Christianity had compelled both the
return of the shipwrecked Japanese and the freedom of the
slave.</p>
<p>This embassy had been suggested and its course planned by a
Christian missionary, who found that of the seventy persons,
one-half had been his pupils.<a id="footnotetag12-26" name=
"footnotetag12-26"></a><a href=
"#footnote12-26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id=
"page373"></a>{373}</span>
<h3>The Imperial Embassy Round the World.</h3>
<p>The purpose of these envoys was, first of all, to ask of the
nations of Christendom equal rights, to get removed the odious
extra-territoriality clause in the treaties, to have the right to
govern aliens on their soil, and to regulate their own tariff.
Secondarily, its members went to study the secrets of power and the
resources of civilization in the West, to initiate the liberal
education of their women by leaving in American schools a little
company of maidens, to enlarge the system of education for their
own country, and to send abroad with approval others of their young
men who, for a decade past had, in spite of every ban and obstacle,
been furtively leaving the country for study beyond the seas.</p>
<p>In the lands of Christendom, the eyes of ambassadors, ministers,
secretaries and students were opened. They saw themselves as others
saw them. They compared their own land and nation, mediaeval in
spirit and backward in resources, and their people untrained as
children, with the modern power, the restless ambition, the stern
purpose, the intense life of the western nations, with their mighty
fleets and armaments, their inventions and machinery, their
economic and social theories and forces, their provision for the
poor, the sick, and the aged, the peerless family life in the
Christian home. They found, further yet, free churches divorced
from politics and independent of the state; that the leading force
of the world was Christianity, that persecution was barbarous, and
that toleration was the law of the future, and largely the
condition of the present. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page374"
id="page374"></a>{374}</span> It took but a few whispers over the
telegraphic wire, and the anti-Christian edicts disappeared from
public view like snowflakes melting on the river. The right arm of
persecution was broken.</p>
<p>The story of the Book of Acts of the modern apostles in Japan is
told, first in the teaching of inquirers, preaching to handfuls,
the gathering of tiny companies, the translation of the Gospel, and
then prayer and waiting for the descent of the Holy Spirit. A study
of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, followed in order to find
out how the Christian Church began. On the 10th day of March, in
the year of our Lord and of the era of Meiji (Enlightened Peace)
the fifth, 1872, at Yokohama, in the little stone chapel built on
part of Commodore Perry's treaty ground, was formed the first
Reformed or Protestant Christian Church in Japan.</p>
<p>At this point our task is ended. We cannot even glance at the
native Christian churches of the Roman, Reformed, or Greek order,
or attempt to appraise the work of the foreign missionaries. He has
read these pages in vain, however, who does not see how well, under
Providence, the Japanese have been trained for higher forms of
faith.</p>
<p>The armies of Japan are upon Chinese soil, while we pen our
closing lines. The last chains of purely local and ethnic dogma are
being snapped asunder. May the sons of Dai Nippon, as they win new
horizons of truth, see more clearly and welcome more loyally that
Prince of Peace whose kingdom is not of this world.</p>
<p>May the age of political conquest end, and the era of the
self-reformation of the Asian nations, through the gospel of Jesus
Christ, be ushered in.</p>

has, in the text, scarcely more than glanced at the subject. In a

for the scientific student of religion, it has been thought best to
be content with a few simple references to what was once widely
prevalent in the Japanese archipelago.</p>

by any foreign scholar is that of Edmund Buckley, A.M., Ph.D., of
the Chicago University, Lecturer on Shint[=o], the Ethnic Faith of
Japan, and on the Science of Religion. Dr. Buckley spent six years
in central and southwestern Japan, most of the time as instructor
in the Doshisha University, Ki[=o]to. He will publish the results
of his personal observations and studios in a monograph on
phallicism, which will be on sale at Chicago University, in which
the Buckley collection illustrating Shint[=o]-worship has been

Shint[=o], is Mr. Ernest Satow, now the British Minister at
Tangier. He received the degree of B.A. from the London University.
After several years' study and experience in China, Mr. Satow came
to Japan in 1861 as student-interpreter to the British Legation,
receiving his first drill under Rev. S.R. Brown, D.D., author of A
Grammar of Colloquial Japanese. To ceaseless industry, this
scholar, to whom the world is so much indebted for knowledge of
Japan, has added philosophic insight. Besides unearthing documents
whose existence was unsuspected, he has cleared the way for
investigators and comparative students by practically removing the
barriers reared by archaic speech and writing. His papers in the
T.A.S.J., on The Shint[=o] Shrines at Is&eacute;, the Revival of
Pure Shint[=o], and Ancient Japanese Rituals, together with his

the comparative history and speech and writing of China, Korea, and
Japan, during the past thirty years. See his valuable papers in the

on Early Japanese History, T.A.S.J., Vol. XVI., pp. 39-75, he
recapitulates the result of his researches, in which he is, in the
main, supported by critical native scholars, and by the late
William Bramsen, in his Japanese Chronological Tables, T[=o]ki[=o],
1880. He considers A.D. 461 as the first trustworthy date in the
Japanese annals. We quote from his paper, Early Japanese History,
T.A.S.J., Vol. XVI., p. 73.</p>
<p>1. The earliest date of the accepted Japanese Chronology, the
accuracy of which is confirmed by external evidence, is A.D.
461.</p>
<p>2. Japanese History, properly so called, can hardly be said to
exist previous to A.D. 500. (A cursory examination leads me to
think that the annals of the sixth century must also be received
with caution.)</p>
<p>3. Korean History and Chronology are more trustworthy than those
of Japan during the period previous to that date.</p>
<p>4. While there was an Empress of Japan in the third century
A.D., the statement that she conquered Korea is highly
improbable.</p>
<p>5. Chinese learning was introduced into Japan from Korea 120
years later than the date given in Japanese History.</p>

<p>Basil Hall Chamberlain, who has done the world of learning such
signal service by his works on the Japanese language, and
especially by his translation, with critical introduction and
commentary, of the Kojiki, is an English gentleman, born at
Southsea, Hampshire, England, on the 18th day of October, 1830. His
mother was a daughter of the well-known traveller and author,
Captain Basil Hall, R.N., and his father an Admiral in the British
Navy. He was educated for Oxford, but instead of entering, for
reasons of health, he spent a number of years in western Mid
southern Europe, acquiring a knowledge of various languages and
literatures. His coming to Japan (in May, 1873) was rather the
result of an accident&mdash;a long sea voyage and a trial of the
Japanese climate having been recommended. The country and the field
of study suited the invalid well. After teaching for a time in the
Naval College the Japanese honored themselves and this scholar by
making him, in April, 1886, Professor of Philology at the Imperial
University. His works, The Classical Poetry of the Japanese, his
various grammars and hand-books for the acquisition of the
language, his Hand-book for Japan, his Aino Studies, Things
Japanese, papers in the T.A.S.J. and his translation of the Kojiki
are all of a high order of value. They are marked by candor,
fairness, insight, and a mastery of difficult themes that makes his
readers his constant debtors.</p>

<p>"The praying for Harvest, or Toshigoi no Matsuri, was celebrated
on the 4th day of the 2d month of each year, at the capital in the
Jin-Gi-Kuan or office for the Worship of the Shint[=o] gods, and in
the provinces by the chiefs of the local administrations. At the
Jin-Gi-Kuan there were assembled the ministers of state, the
functionaries of that office, the priests and priestesses of 573
temples, containing 737 shrines, which were kept up at the expense
of the Mikado's treasury, while the governors of the provinces
superintended in the districts under their administration the
performance of rites in honor of 2,395 other shrines. It would not
be easy to state the exact number of deities to whom these 3,132
shrines were dedicated. A glance over the list in the 9th and 10th
books of the Yengishiki shows at once that there were many gods who
were worshipped in more than half-a-dozen different localities at
the same time; but exact calculation is impossible, because in many
cases only the names of the temples are given, and we are left
quite in the dark as to the individuality of the gods to whom they
were sacred. Besides these 3,132 shrines, which are distinguished
as Shikidai, that is contained in the catalogue of the Yengishiki,
there were a large number of enumerated shrines in temples
scattered all over the country, in every village or hamlet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id=
"page388"></a>{388}</span> of which it was impossible to take any
account, just as at the present day there are temples of Hachiman,
Kompira, Tenjin sama, San-no sama and Sengen sama, as they are
popularly called, wherever twenty or thirty houses are collected
together. The shrines are classed as great and small, the
respective numbers being 492 and 2,640, the distinction being
twofold, firstly in the proportionately larger quantity of
offerings made at the great shrines, and secondly that the
offerings in the one case were arranged upon tables or altars,
while in the other they were placed on mats spread upon the earth.
In the Yengishiki the amounts and nature of the offerings are
stated with great minuteness, but it will be sufficient if the
kinds of articles offered are alone mentioned here. It will be
seen, by comparison with the text of the norito, that they had
varied somewhat since the date when the ritual was composed. The
offerings to a greater shrine consisted of coarse woven silk
(<i>ashiginu</i>), thin silk of five different colors, a kind of
stuff called <i>shidori</i> or <i>shidzu</i>, which is supposed by
some to have been a striped silk, cloth of broussonetia bark or
hemp, and a small quantity of the raw materials of which the cloth
was made, models of swords, a pair of tables or altars (called
<i>yo-kura-oki</i> and <i>ya-kura-oki</i>), a shield or mantlet, a
spear-head, a bow, a quiver, a pair of stag's horns, a hoe, a few
measures of sak&eacute; or rice-beer, some haliotis and bonito, two
measures of <i>kituli</i> (supposed to be salt roe), various kinds
of edible seaweed, a measure of salt, a sak&eacute; jar, and a few
feet of matting for packing. To each of the temples of Watarai in
Is&eacute; was presented in addition a horse; to the temple of the
Harvest god Mitoshi no kami, a <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page389" id="page389"></a>{389}</span> white horse, cock, and pig,
and a horse to each of nineteen others.</p>
<p>"During the fortnight which preceded the celebration of the
service, two smiths and their journeymen, and two carpenters,
together with eight inbe [or hereditary priests] were employed in
preparing the apparatus and getting ready the offerings. It was
usual to employ for the Praying for Harvest members of this tribe
who held office in the Jin-Gi-Kuan, but if the number could not he
made up in that office, it was supplied from other departments of
state. To the tribe of quiver-makers was intrusted the special duty
of weaving the quivers of wistaria tendrils. The service began at
twenty minutes to seven in the morning, by our reckoning of time.
After the governor of the province of Yamashiro had ascertained
that everything was in readiness, the officials of the Jin-Gi-Kuan
arranged the offerings on the tables and below them, according to
the rank of the shrines for which they were intended. The large
court of the Jin-Gi-Kuan where the service was held, called the
Sai-in, measured 230 feet by 370. At one end were the offices and
on the west side were the shrines of the eight Protective Deities
in a row, surrounded by a fence, to the interior of which three
sacred archways (torii) gave access. In the centre of the court a
temporary shed was erected for the occasion, in which the tables or
altars were placed. The final preparations being now complete, the
ministers of state, the virgin priestesses and priests of the
temples to which offerings were sent by the Mikado, entered in
succession, and took the places severally assigned to them. The
horses which formed a part of the offerings were next brought in
from the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id=
"page390"></a>{390}</span> Mikado's stable, and all the
congregation drew near, while the reader recited or read the
norito. This reader was a member of the priestly family or tribe of
Nakatomi, who traced their descent back to Ameno-koyan&eacute;, one
of the principal advisers attached to the sun-goddess's grandchild
when he first descended on earth. It is a remarkable evidence of
the persistence of certain ideas, that up to the year 1868 the
nominal prime-minister of the Mikado, after he came of age, and the
regent during his minority, if he had succeeded young to the
throne, always belonged to this tribe, which changed its name from
Nakatomi to Fujiwara in the seventh century, and was subsequently
split up into the Five Setsuk&eacute; or governing families. At the
end of each section the priests all responded 'O!' which was no
doubt the equivalent of 'Yes' in use in those days. As soon as he
had finished, the Nakatomi retired, and the offerings were
distributed to the priests for conveyance and presentation to the
gods to whose service they were attached. But a special messenger
was despatched with the offerings destined to the temples at
Watarai. This formality having been completed, the President of the
Jin-Gi-Kuan gave the signal for breaking up the assembly." Ancient

<p>In the official census of 1893, nine Shint[=o] sects are named,
each of which has its own Kwancho or Presiding Head, recognized by
the government. The sectarian peculiarities of Shint[=o] have been
made the subject of study by very few foreigners. Mr. Satow names
the following:</p>
<p>The Yui-itsu sect was founded by Toshida Kan&eacute;-tomo. His
signature appears as the end of a ten-volume edition, issued A.D.
1503, of the liturgies extracted from the Yengishiki or Book of
Ceremonial Law, first published in the era of Yengi (or En-gi),
A.D. 901-922. He is supposed to be the one who added the
<i>kana</i>, or common vernacular script letters, to the Chinese
text and thus made the norito accessible to the people. The little
pocket prayer-books, folded in an accordeon-like manner, are very
cheap and popular. The sect is regarded as heretical by strict
Shint[=o]ists, as the system Yuwiitsu consists "mainly of a
Buddhist superstructure on a Shint[=o] foundation." Yoshida applied
the tenets of the Shingon or True Word sect of Buddhists to the
understanding and practice of the ancient god-way.</p>
<p>The Suiga sect teaches a system which is a combination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id=
"page395"></a>{395}</span> of Yuwiitsu and of the modern
philosophical form of Confucianism as elaborated by Chu Hi, and
known in Japan as the T&eacute;i-shu philosophy. The founder was
Yamazaki Ansai, who was born in 1618 and died in 1682. By combining
the forms of the Yoshida sect, which is based on the Buddhism of
the Shingon sect, with the materialistic philosophy of Chu Hi, he
adapted the old god-way to what he deemed modern needs.</p>
<p>In the D&eacute;guchi sect, the ancient belief is explained by
the Chinese Book of Changes (or Divination). D&eacute;guchi
Nobuyoshi, the founder, was god-warden or <i>kannushi</i> of the
G&eacute;iku or Outer Palace Temple at Is&eacute;. He promulgated
his views about the year 1660, basing them upon the book called
&Eacute;ki by the Japanese and Yi-king by the Chinese. This
Yi-king, which Professor Terrien de Laeouporie declares is only a
very ancient book of pronunciation of comparative Accadian and
Chinese Syllabaries, has been the cause of incredible waste of
labor, time, and brains in China&mdash;enough to have diked the
Yellow River or drained the swamps of the Empire. It is the chief
basis of Chinese superstition, and the greatest literary barrier to
the advance of civilization. It has also made much mischief in
Japan. D&eacute;guchi explained the myths of the age of the gods by
divination or &eacute;ki, based on the Chinese books. As late as
1893 there was published in T[=o]ki[=o] a work in Japanese, with
good translation info English, on Scientific Morality, or the
practical guidance of life by means of divination&mdash;The
Takashima &Eacute;kidan (or Monograph on the &Eacute;ki of Mr.
Takashima), by S. Sugiura.</p>
<p>The Jikko sect, according to its representative at <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page396" id="page396"></a>{396}</span> the
World's Parliament of Religions at Chicago, is "the practical." It
lays stress less upon speculation and ritual, and more upon the
realization of the best teachings of Shint[=o]. It was founded by
Has&eacute;gawa Kakugi[=o], who was born at Nagasaki in 1541.
Living in a cave in Fuji-yama, "he received inspiration through the
miraculous power of the mountain." It believes in one absolute
Deity, often mentioned in the Kojiki, which, self-originated, took
the embodiment of two deities, one with the male nature and the
other female, though these two deities are nothing but forms of the
one substance and unite again in the absolute deity. These gave
birth to the Japanese Archipelago, the sun and moon, the mountains
and streams, the divine ancestors, etc. According to the teachings
of this sect, the peerless mountain, Fuji, ought to be reverenced
as the sacred abode of the divine lord, and as "the brains of the
whole globe." The believer must make Fuji the example and emblem of
his thought and action. He must be plain and simple, as the form of
the mountain, making his body and mind pure and serene, as Fuji
itself. The present world with all its practical works must be
respected more than the future world. We must pray for the long
life of the country, lead a life of temperance and diligence,
cooperating with one another in doing good.</p>

<p><i>Statistics of Shint[=o]ism.</i></p>
<p>From the official R&eacute;sum&eacute; Statistique de l'Empire
du Japon, 1894. In 1801 there were nine administrative heads of
sects; 75,877 preachers, priests, and shrine-keepers, with 1,158
male and 228 female students. <span class="pagenum"><a name=

temples of superior rank and 136,652 shrines or temples in cities
and prefectures; a total of 193,153, served by 14,700 persons of
the grade of priests. Most of the expenses, apart from endowments
and local contributions, are included in the first item of the
annual Treasury Budget, "Civil List, Appanage and Shint[=o]

<p>Jap. Mon-ju. One of the most famous images of this Bodhisattva
is at Zenk&ocirc;-ji, Nagano. See Kern's Saddharma Pundarika, p. 8,
and the many referents to Manjusri in the Index. That Manjusri was
the legendary civilizer of Nepaul seems probable from the following
extract from Brian Hodgson: <span class="pagenum"><a name="page408"
id="page408"></a>{408}</span> "The Swayambhu Purana relates in
substance as follows: That formerly the valley of Nepaul was of
circular form, and full of very deep water, and that the mountains
confining it were clothed with the densest forests, giving shelter
to numberless birds and beasts. Countless waterfowl rejoiced in the
waters....</p>
<p>"... Vipasyi, having thrice circumambulated the lake, seated
himself in the N.W. (V&aacute;yubona) side of it, and, having
repeated several mantras over the root of a lotos, he threw it into
the water, exclaiming, 'What time this root shall produce a flower,
then, from out of the flower, Swayambhu, the Lord of Agnishtha
Bhuvana, shall be revealed in the form of flame; and then shall the
lake become a cultivated and populous country.' Having repeated
these words, Vipasyi departed. Long after the date of this
prophecy, it was fulfilled according to the letter....</p>
<p>"... When the lake was dessicated (by the sword of Manjusri says
the myth&mdash;probably earthquake) Karkotaka had a fine tank built
for him to dwell in; and there he is still worshipped, also in the
cave-temple appendant to the great Buddhist shrine of Swayambhu
Nath....</p>
<p>"... The Bodhisatwa above alluded to is Manju Sri, whose native
place is very far off, towards the north, and is called Pancha
Sirsha Parvata (which is situated in Maha China Des). After the
coming of Viswabhu Buddha to Naga Vasa, Manju Sri, meditating upon
what was passing in the world, discovered by means of his divine
science that Swayambhu-jyotirupa, that is, the self-existent, in
the form of flame, was revealed out of a lotos in the lake of Naga
Vasa. Again, he reflected within himself: 'Let me behold that
sacred spot, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page409" id=
"page409"></a>{409}</span> my name will long be celebrated in the
world;' and on the instant, collecting together his disciples,
comprising a multitude of the peasantry of the land, and a Raja
named Dharmakar, he assumed the form of Viswakarma, and with his
two Devis (wives) and the persons above-mentioned, set out upon the
long journey from Sirsha Parvata to Naga Vasa. There having
arrived, and having made puja to the self-existent, he began to
circumambulate the lake, beseeching all the while the aid of
Swayambhu in prayer. In the second circuit, when he had reached the
central barrier mountain to the south, he became satisfied that
that was the best place whereat to draw off the waters of the lake.
Immediately he struck the mountain with his scimitar, when the
sundered rock gave passage to the waters, and the bottom of the
lake became dry. He then descended from the mountain, and began to
walk about the valley in all directions."&mdash;The Phoenix, Vol.
II., pp. 147-148.</p>

<p>Davids's Buddhism, p. 206. Other illustrations of the growth of
the dogmas of this school of Buddhism we select from Brian
Hodgson's writings.</p>
<p>1. The line of division between God and man, and between gods
and man, was removed by Buddhism.</p>
<p>"Genuine Buddhism never seems to contemplate any measures of
acceptance with the deity; but, overleaping the barrier between
finite and infinite mind, urges its followers to aspire by their
own efforts to that divine perfectibility of which it teaches that
man is capable, and by attaining which man becomes God&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page411" id=
"page411"></a>{411}</span> thus is explained both the quiescence of
the imaginary celestial, and the plenary omnipotence of the real
Manushi Buddhas&mdash;thus, too, we must account for the fact that
genuine Buddhism has no priesthood; the saint despises the priest;
the saint scorns the aid of mediators, whether on earth or in
heaven; 'conquer (exclaims the adept or Buddha to the novice or
BodhiSattwa)&mdash;conquer the importunities of the body, urge your
mind to the meditation of abstraction, and you shall, in time,
discover the great secret (Sunyata) of nature: know this, and you
become, on the instant, whatever priests have feigned of
Godhead&mdash;you become identified with Prajna, the sum of all the
power and all the wisdom which sustain and govern the world, and
which, as they are manifested out of matter, must belong solely to
matter; not indeed in the gross and palpable state of pravritti,
but in the archetypal and pure state of nirvritti. Put off,
therefore, the vile, pravrittika necessities of the body, and the
no less vile affections of the mind (Tapas); urge your thought into
pure abstraction (Dhyana), and then, as assuredly you can, so
assuredly you shall, attain to the wisdom of a Buddha (Bodhijnana),
and become associated with the eternal unity and rest of
nirvritti.'"&mdash;The Phoenix, Vol. I., p. 194.</p>
<p>2. A specimen of "esoteric" and "exoteric" Buddhism;&mdash;the
Buddha Tatkagata.</p>
<p>"And as the wisdom of man is, in its origin, but an effluence of
the Supreme wisdom (<i>Prajn&aacute;</i>) of nature, so is it
perfected by a refluence to its source, but without loss of
individuality; whence Prajna is feigned in the exoteric system to
be both the mother and the wife of all the Buddhas, '<i>janani
sarva Buddk&aacute;n&aacute;m</i>,' and '<i>Jina-sundary</i>;'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id=
"page412"></a>{412}</span> for the efflux is typified by a birth,
and the reflux by a marriage.</p>
<p>"The Buddha is the adept in the wisdom of Buddhism
(<i>Bodhijn&aacute;na</i>) whose first duty, so long as he remains
on earth, is to communicate his wisdom to those who are willing to
receive it. These willing learners are the 'Bodhisattwas,' so
called from their hearts being inclined to the wisdom of Buddhism,
and 'Sanghas,' from their companionship with one another, and with
their Buddha or teacher, in the <i>Vih&aacute;ras</i> or
coenobitical establishments."</p>
<p>"And such is the esoteric interpretation of the third (and
inferior) member of the Prajniki Triad. The Bodhisattwa or Sangha
continues to be such until he has surmounted the very last grade of
that vast and laborious ascent by which he is instructed that he
can 'scale the heavens,' and pluck immortal wisdom from its
resplendent source: which achievement performed, he becomes a
Buddha, that is, an Omniscient Being, and a
<i>Tath&aacute;gata</i>&mdash;a title implying the accomplishment
of that gradual increase in wisdom by which man becomes immortal or
ceases to be subject to transmigration."&mdash;The Phoenix, Vol.
I., pp. 194, 195.</p>
<p>3. Is God all, or is all God?</p>
<p>"What that grand secret, that ultimate truth, that single
reality, is, whether all is God, or God is all, seems to be the
sole <i>proposition</i> of the oriental philosophic religionists,
who have all alike sought to discover it by taking the high
<i>priori</i> road. That God is all, appears to be the prevalent
dogmatic determination of the Brahmanists; that all is God, the
preferential but sceptical solution of the <i>Buddhists</i>; and,
in a large view, I believe it would be difficult to indicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page413" id=
"page413"></a>{413}</span> any further essential difference between
their theoretic systems, both, as I conceive, the unquestionable
growth of the Indian soil, and both founded upon transcendental
speculation, conducted in the very same style and
manner."&mdash;The Phoenix, Vol. II., p. 45.</p>
<p>4. Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.</p>
<p>"In a philosophical light, the precedence of Buddha or of Dharma
indicates the theistic or atheistic school. With the former, Buddha
is intellectual essence, the efficient cause of all, and underived.
Dharma is material essence, the plastic cause, and underived, a
co-equal biunity with Buddha; or else the plastic cause, as before,
but dependent and derived from Buddha. Sangha is derived from, and
compounded of, Buddha, and Dharma, is their collective energy in
the state of action; the immediate operative cause of creation, its
type or its agent. With the latter or atheistic schools, Dharma is
<i>Diva natura</i>, matter as the sole entity, invested with
intrinsic activity and intelligence, the efficient and material
cause of all.</p>
<p>"Buddha is derivative from Dharma, is the active and intelligent
force of nature, first put off from it and then operating upon it.
Sangha is the <i>result</i> of that operation; is embryotic
creation, the type and sum of all specific forms, which are
spontaneously evolved from the union of Buddha with
Dharma."&mdash;The Phoenix, Vol. II., p. 12.</p>
<p>5. The mantra or sacred sentence best known in the Buddhadom and
abroad.</p>
<p>"<i>Amit&aacute;bha</i> is the fourth <i>Dhyani</i> or celestial
<i>Budda: Padma-pani</i> his <i>&AElig;on</i> and executive
minister. <i>Padma-pani</i> is the <i>praesens Divus</i> and
creator of the <i>existing</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page414" id="page414"></a>{414}</span> system of worlds. Hence his
identification with the third member of the <i>Triad</i>. He is
figured as a graceful youth, erect, and bearing in either hand a
<i>lotos</i> and a jewel. The last circumstance explains the
meaning of the celebrated <i>Shadaksh&aacute;ri Mantra</i>, or
six-lettered invocation of him, viz., <i>Om! Manipadme hom!</i> of
which so many corrupt versions and more corrupt interpretations
have appeared from Chinese, Tibetan, Mongolian, and other sources.
The <i>mantra</i> in question is one of three, addressed to the
several members of the <i>Triad</i>. 1. <i>Om sarva vidye hom</i>.
2. <i>Om Prajn&aacute;ye hom</i>. 3. <i>Om mani-padme hom</i>. 1.
The mystic triform Deity is in the all-wise (Buddha). 2. The mystic
triform Deity is in Prajna (Dharma). 3. The mystic triform Deity is
in him of the jewel and lotos (Sangha). But the praesens Divus,
whether he be Augustus or <i>Padma-pani</i>, is everything with the
many. Hence the notoriety of this <i>mantra</i>, whilst the others
are hardly ever heard of, and have thus remained unknown to our
travellers."&mdash;The Phoenix, Vol. II., p. 64.</p>

<p>The native literature illustrating Riy[=o]buism is not
extensive. Mr. Ernest Satow in the American Cyclop&aelig;dia
(Japan: Literature) mentions several volumes. The Tenchi
R&eacute;iki Noko, in eighteen books contains a mixture of Buddhism
and Shint[=o], and is ascribed by some to Sh[=o]toku and by others
to K[=o]b[=o], but now literary critics ascribe these, as well as
the books Jimbetsuki and Tenshoki, to be modern forgeries by
Buddhist priests. The Kogoshiui, written in A.D. 807, professes to
preserve fragments of ancient tradition not recorded in the earlier
books, but the main object is that which lies at the basis of a
vast mass of Japanese literature, namely, to prove the author's own
descent from the gods. The Yuiitsu Shint[=o] Miyoho Yoshiu,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id=
"page420"></a>{420}</span> in two volumes, is designed to prove
that Shint[=o] and Buddhism are identical in their essence. Indeed,
almost all the treatises on Shint[=o] before the seventeenth
century maintained this view. Certain books like the Shint[=o] Shu,
for centuries popular, and well received even by scholars, are now
condemned on account of their confusion of the two religions. One
of the most interesting works which we have found is the San Kai
Ri, to which reference has been made.</p>

<p>Much of the information as to history and doctrine contained in
this chapter has been condensed from Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio's A Short
History of the Twelve Japanese Buddhist Sects, translated out of
the Japanese into English. This author, besides visiting the old
seats of the faith in China, studied Sanskrit at Oxford with
Professor Max M&uuml;ller, and catalogued in English the Tripitaka
or Buddhist canon of China and Japan, sent to England by the
ambassador Iwakura. The nine reverend gentlemen who wrote the
chapters and introduction of the Short History are Messrs.
K[=o]-ch[=o] Ogurusu, and Shu-Zan Emura of the Shin sect; Rev.
Messrs. Sh[=o]-hen U&eacute;da, and Dai-ryo Takashi, of the
Shin-gon Sect; Rev. Messrs. Gy[=o]-kai Fukuda, Keu-k[=o] Tsuji,
Renj[=o] Akamatsu, and Z&eacute;-jun Kobayashi of the J[=o]-d[=o],
Zen, Shin, and Nichiren sects, respectively. Though execrably
printed, and the English only tolerable, the work is invaluable to
the student of Japanese Buddhism. It has a historical introduction
and a Sanskrit-Chinese Index, 1 vol., pp. 172, T[=o]ki[=o], 1887.
Substantially the same work, translated into French, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page422" id="page422"></a>{422}</span> is Le
Bouddhisme Japonais, by Ryauon Fujishima, Paris, 1889. Satow and
Hawes's Hand-book for Japan has brief but valuable notes in the
Introduction, and, like Chamberlain's continuation of the same
work, is a storehouse of illustrative matter. Edkine's and Eitel's
works on Chinese Buddhism have been very helpful.</p>

exquisite humor of this satire in their sympathy with the woes of

animals grows directly out of the doctrine of metempsychosis. The
relationship between man and ape is founded upon the pantheistic
identity of being. "We mention sin," says a missionary now in
Japan, "and he [the average auditor] thinks of eating flesh, or the
killing of insects." Many of the sutras read like tracts and

<p>The word <i>vagra</i>, diamond, is a constituent in scores of
names of sutras, especially those whose contents are metaphysical
in their nature. The Vajrasan, Diamond Throne or Thunderbolt seat,
was the name applied to the most sacred part of the great temple
reared by Asoka on the site of the bodhi tree, under which Gautama
received enlightenment. "The adamantine truths of Buddha struck
like a thunderbolt upon the superstitious of his age." "The word
vagra has the two senses of hardness and utility. In the former
sense it is understood to be compared to the secret truth which is
always in existence and not to be broken. In the latter sense it
implies the power of the enlightened, that destroys the obstacles
of passions."&mdash;B.N., p. 88. "As held in the arms of Kwannon
and other images in the temples," the vagra or "diamond club" (is
that) with which the foes of the Buddhist Church are to be
crushed.&mdash;S. and H., p. 444. Each of the gateway gods Ni-[=o]
(two Kings, Indra and Brahma) "bears in his hand the tokko

represent a diamond <span class="pagenum"><a name="page432" id=

exhausted, and no volume of melody followed (after having been

affairs, we made a subscription, and collected coin to obtain a new
bell. All believers in the doctrine, gods as well as devils,
contributed freely. Thus the enterprise was soon consummated, and
this inscription prepared, to wit:</p>

people, would, by means of this bell, instead of words, awaken them
from earthly illusions, and reveal the darkness of this world.</p>

confession, are freed from the bondage of their sins, and forever

<p>I have some good reasons for making this suggestion. Yokoi
H&eacute;ishiro had dwelt for some time in Fukui, a few rods away
from the house in which I lived, and the ideas he promulgated among
the Echizen clansmen in his lectures on Confucianism, were not only
Christian in spirit but, by their own statement, these ideas could
not be found in the texts of the Chinese sage or of his
commentators. Although the volume (edited by his son, Rev. J.F.
Yokoi) of his Life and Letters shows him to have been an intense
and at times almost bigoted Confucianist, he, in one of his later
letters, prophesied that when Christianity <span class=

<p>"Fate is one of the great words of the East. <i>Japan's language
is loaded and overloaded with it.</i> Parents are forever saying
before their children, 'There's no help for it.' I once remarked to
a school-teacher, 'Of course you love to teach children.' His quick
reply was, 'Of course I don't. I do it merely because there is no
help for it.' Moralists here deplore the prosperity of the houses
of ill-fame and then add with a sigh, 'There's no help for it.' All
society reverberates with this phrase with reference to questions
that need the application of moral power, will power."&mdash;J.H.

Nor do I say there is no weak yielding to fate in lands that have
the doctrine of the Creator, for there is. But, putting the East
and West side by side, one need not hesitate to affirm that the
reason the will power of the East is weak cannot be fully explained
by any mere doctrine of environment, but must also have some vital
connection with the fact that the idea of a personal almighty
Creator has for long ages been <span class="pagenum"><a name=

western nations have an aggressive character that ventures bold
things and tends to defy difficulties cannot be wholly laid to

millions daily reverently to say 'I believe in the Almighty Father,
Maker of Heaven and Earth.'"&mdash;J.H. De Forest.</p>

<p>STATISTICS OF BUDDHISM IN JAPAN.</p>
<p>(From The official "R&eacute;sum&eacute; Statistique de l'Empire
du Japon," T[=o]ki[=o], 1894.)</p>
<p>In 1891 there were 71,859 temples within city or town limits,
and 35,959 in the rural districts, or 117,718 in all, under the
charges of 51,791 principal priests and 720 principal priestesses,
or 52,511 in all.</p>
<p>The number of temples, classified by sects, were as follows:
Tendai, with 3 sub-sects, 4,808; Shingon, with 2 sub-sects, 12,821,
of which 45 belonged to the Hoss[=o] shu; J[=o]-do, with 2
sub-sects, 8,323, of which 21 were of the K&eacute;-gon shu; Zen,
with 3 sub-sects, 20,882, of which 6,146 were of the Rin-Zai shu;
14,072 of the S[=o]-d[=o] shu, and 604 of the O-bakushu; Shin, with
10 sub-sects, 19,146; Nichiren, with 7 sub-sects, 5,066; Ji shu,
515; Yu-dz[=u]; Nembutsu, 358; total, 38 sects and 71,859
temples.</p>
<p>The official reports required by the government from the various
sects, show that there are 38 administrative heads of sects; 52,638
priest-preachers and 44,123 ordinary priests or monks; and 8,668
male and 328 female, or a total of 8,996, students for the grade of
monk or nun. In comparison with 1886, the number of
priest-preachers was 39,261, ordinary priests 38,189: male
students, 21,966; female students, 642.</p>

<p>Since the abolition of feudalism, with the increase of the means
of transportation, the larger freedom, and, at many points,
improved morality, the population of Japan shows an unprecedented
rate of increase. The census taken in 1744 gave, as the total
number of souls in the empire, 26,080,000 (E.J. Reed's Japan, Vol.
I., p. 236); that of 1872, 33,110,825; that of 1892, 41,089,910,
showing a greater increase during the past twenty years than in the
one hundred and thirty-eight years previous. See

<p>A typical instance was that of Rin Shihei, born 1737, author of
<i>Sun Koku Tsu Ran to Setsu</i>, translated into French by
Klaproth, Paris, 1832. Rin learned much from the Dutch and
Prussians, and wrote books which had a great sale. He was cast into
prison, whence he never emerged. The (wooden) plates of his
publications were confiscated and destroyed. In 1876, the Mikado
visited his grave in Sendai, and ordered a monument erected to the
honor of this far-seeing patriot.</p>

<p>A somewhat voluminous native Japanese literature is the result
of the various embassies and individual pilgrimages abroad, since
1860. Immeasurably superior to all other publications, in the
practical influence over his fellow-countrymen, is the S&eacute;iyo
Jijo (The Condition of Western Countries) by Fukuzawa, author,
educator, editor, decliner of numerously proffered political
offices, and "the intellectual father of one-half of the young men
who now fill the middle and lower posts in the government of
Japan." For the foreign side, see The Japanese in America, by
Charles Lanman, New York, 1872, and in The Life of Sir Harry
Parkes, London, 1894, and for an amusing piece of <span class=

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
